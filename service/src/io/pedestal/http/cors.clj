  - a function of one argument that returns a truthy value when an origin is allowed

  - a map containing the following keys and values

    :allowed-origins - either sequence of strings or a function as above

    :creds - true or false, indicates whether client is allowed to send credentials

    :max-age - a long, indicates the number of seconds a client should cache the response from a preflight request
