  "Returns a CORS interceptor that allows calls from the specified `allowed-origins`, which is one of the following:

  * a sequence of strings
  * a function of one argument that returns a truthy value when an origin is allowed
  * a map of options

  For a map, the expected keys are:
  
  * :allowed-origins - either sequence of strings or a function as above
  * :creds - true or false, indicates whether client is allowed to send credentials
  * :max-age - a long, indicates the number of seconds a client should cache the response from a preflight request
  * :methods - a string, indicates the accepted HTTP methods.  Defaults to \"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS\"
  * :level - logging level, defaults to :debug

  The :level option was added in 0.8.0 (previously, logging was always at the :info level)."
