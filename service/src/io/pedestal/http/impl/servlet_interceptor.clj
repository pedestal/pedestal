  After entering this interceptor, the context will contain a new
  key :request, the value will be a request map adhering to the Ring
  specification[1].

  This interceptor supports asynchronous responses as defined in the
  Java Servlet Specification[2] version 3.0. On leaving this
  interceptor, if the servlet request has been set asynchronous, all
  asynchronous resources will be closed. Pausing this interceptor will
  inform the servlet container that the response will be delivered
  asynchronously.

  If a later interceptor in this context throws an exception which is
  not caught, this interceptor will log the error but not communicate
  any details to the client.
