  The provided route-fragments must extend the [[ExpandableRoutes]] protocol; these will
  either be [[RoutingFragment]]s (from directly invoking a function such as
  [[table-routes]]) or a data structure (vector, map, or set) that can be implicitly
  converted to a RoutingFragment.

(defn with-default-interceptors
  "Sets up a default set of interceptors for _early_ development of an application.

  **It is expected that an application under active development will not use this function, but
  will provide its own interceptor stack explicitly.**

  These interceptors provide basic secure functionality with a limited amount of configurability.
  Many of the underlying interceptors can be configured for greater security.

  A routing interceptor should be added after all other interceptors.

  Interceptors (in order):

  Role                       | Description                                   | Provided By

  Request tracing            | Make request observable via Open Telemetry    | [[request-tracing-interceptor]]
  Request logging            | Log incoming request method and URI           | [[log-request]]
  Allowed origins (optional) | Only allow requests from specified origins    | [[allow-origin]]
  Not Found                  | Report lack of response as a status 404       | [[not-found]]
  Session support (optional) | Persist data between requests                 | [[session]]
  Body params                | Parse JSON, EDN, etc. body into appropriate  parameters (:edn-body, :json-body, etc.) | [[body-params]]
  Default content type       | Set response content type from request file extension, if not otherwise set | [[content-type]]
  Query parameters           | Decode request :query-string to :query-params | [[query-params]]
  Secure headers             | Ensures a number of security-related headers  | [[secure-headers]]

  Note that application code *should not* depend on the exact names of the interceptors, as those may be subject
  to change.
