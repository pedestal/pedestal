  Note:
    No additional interceptors are added if :interceptors key is set.

  Options:

  * :routes: Something that satisfies the io.pedestal.http.route/ExpandableRoutes protocol
    a function that returns routes when called, or a seq of route maps that defines a service's routes.
    If passing in a seq of route maps, it's recommended to use io.pedestal.http.route/expand-routes.
  * :router: The router implementation to to use. Can be :linear-search, :map-tree
    :prefix-tree, or a custom Router constructor function. Defaults to :map-tree, which fallsback on :prefix-tree
  * :file-path: File path used as root by the middlewares/file interceptor. If nil, this interceptor
    is not added. Default is nil.
  * :resource-path: File path used as root by the middlewares/resource interceptor. If nil, this interceptor
    is not added. Default is nil.
  * :method-param-name: Query string parameter used to set the current HTTP verb. Default is _method.
  * :allowed-origins: Determines what origins are allowed for the cors/allow-origin interceptor. If
     nil, this interceptor is not added. Default is nil.
  * :not-found-interceptor: Interceptor to use when returning a not found response. Default is
     the not-found interceptor. `nil` to disable.
  * :request-logger: Interceptor to log requests entering the interceptor chain. Default is
     the log-request interceptor. `nil` to disable.
  * :mime-types: Mime-types map used by the middlewares/content-type interceptor. Default is {}.
  * :enable-session: A settings map to include the session middleware interceptor. If nil, this interceptor
     is not added.  Default is nil.
  * :enable-csrf: A settings map to include the csrf-protection interceptor. This implies
     sessions are enabled. If nil, this interceptor is not added. Default is nil.
  * :secure-headers: A settings map for various secure headers.
     Keys are: [:hsts-settings :frame-options-settings :content-type-settings :xss-protection-settings :download-options-settings :cross-domain-policies-settings :content-security-policy-settings]
     If nil, this interceptor is not added.  Default is the default secure-headers settings
  * :path-params-decoder: An Interceptor to decode path params. Default is URL Decoding via `io.pedestal.http.route/path-params-decoder.
     If nil, this interceptor is not added."
