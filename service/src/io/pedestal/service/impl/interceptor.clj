  An Interceptor is a map or map-like object with the keys :enter,
  :leave, and :error. The value of each key is a function; missing
  keys or nil values are ignored. When executing a context, first all
  the :enter functions are invoked in order. As this happens, the
  Interceptors are pushed on to a stack.

  When execution reaches the end of the queue, it begins popping
  Interceptors off the stack and calling their :leave functions.
  Therefore :leave functions are called in the opposite order from
  :enter functions.

  Both the :enter and :leave functions are called on a single
  argument, the context map, and return an updated context.

  If any Interceptor function throws an exception, execution stops and
  begins popping Interceptors off the stack and calling their :error
  functions. The :error function takes two arguments: the context and
  an exception. It may either handle the exception, in which case the
  execution continues with the next :leave function on the stack; or
  re-throw the exception, passing control to the :error function on
  the stack. If the exception reaches the end of the stack without
  being handled, execute will throw it."
