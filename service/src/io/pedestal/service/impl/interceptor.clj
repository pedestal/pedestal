  "Executes a queue of Interceptors attached to the context. Context
  must be a map, Interceptors are added with 'enqueue'.

  An Interceptor is a map or map-like object with the keys :enter,
  :leave, :error, :pause, and :resume. The value of each key is a
  function; missing keys or nil values are ignored. When executing a
  context, first all the :enter functions are invoked in order. As
  this happens, the Interceptors are pushed on to a stack.

  When execution reaches the end of the queue, it begins popping
  Interceptors off the stack and calling their :leave functions.
  Therefore :leave functions are called in the opposite order from
  :enter functions.

  Both the :enter and :leave functions are called on a single
  argument, the context map, and return an updated context.

  If any Interceptor function throws an exception, execution stops and
  begins popping Interceptors off the stack and calling their :error
  functions. The :error function takes two arguments: the context and
  an exception. It may either handle the exception, in which case the
  execution continues with the next :leave function on the stack; or
  re-throw the exception, passing control to the :error function on
  the stack. If the exception reaches the end of the stack without
  being handled, execute will throw it.

  The :pause and :resume functions are used in asynchronous contexts.
  Any :enter or :leave function may call 'pause' to suspend the
  current execution, after which it MUST return nil. See also
  'with-pause'. Before returning, the function can dispatch operation
  to another thread or schedule it for later execution. When it is
  time to continue execution, another thread should call 'resume'.

  When 'pause' is called, the :pause functions of any Interceptors
  currently on the stack will be invoked. These functions may be used,
  for example, to release resources that will not be needed while
  waiting for some external event. When 'resume' is called, the
  :resume functions are invoked in the opposite order."
