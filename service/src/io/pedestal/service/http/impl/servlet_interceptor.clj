  After entering this interceptor, the context will contain a new
  key :request, the value will be a request map adhering to the Ring
  specification[1].

  This interceptor supports asynchronous responses as defined in the
  Java Servlet Specification[2] version 3.0. On leaving this
  interceptor, if the context was flagged as asynchronous, all
  asynchronous resources will be cleaned. Pausing this interceptor
  will inform the servlet container that the response will be
  delivered asynchronously, and flag the context this interceptor is
  processing as asynchronous.

  If a later interceptor in this context throws an exception which is
  not caught, this interceptor will log the error but not communicate
  any details to the client.
