# Pedestal Changelog

**NOTE:** Whenever upgrading versions of pedestal-app, please be sure to clean your project's `out` directory by running `lein clean`.

## 0.2.0 - August 26, 2013

This is a big one folks. Developer tooling has moved from generated projects into
the app- and service-tools libraries.

**If you want to take advantage of all the super-awesome new features then further action is required.**
See the respective changelogs in App and Service for more info.

### App

* Developer tooling has moved in its entirety to app-tools.
  
  Notable improvements:
    * Tooling functions are automaticly included when running `lein repl`.
    * App configuration can be reloaded with `(reload-config)`
    * Future upgrades to tooling will be incorporated more easily.
  
  Additionally, app configuration is specified by an EDN file (instead of an
  executable Clojure file.) New projects will make use of this feature, but
  pre-0.2.0 generated projects will not.
  
  **You do not *have* to make this upgrade, but we *suggest* you do.**

  The easiest way to upgrade is to re-generate your application with the 0.2.0
  app-template and transfer your existing code into it. It is possible, however,
  to migrate your existing application.

  **How to migrate a 0.1.x project to 0.2.0:**
      1. Remove the `dev/` folder.
      2. `$ touch config/user.clj` -- This is needed for `:repl-options` with `:init user` to work.
      3. Update your `project.clj`'s `:main` and `:repl-options` keys [like so](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/3a09c783dde7bf2b3bd1fd6435ec66f9eafe30d7/app-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_app/project.clj#L14-L23).
      4. Add the [piggieback dependency](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/3a09c783dde7bf2b3bd1fd6435ec66f9eafe30d7/app-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_app/project.clj#L9) to your `project.clj` (`[com.cemerick/piggieback "0.1.0"]`).
      5. Update your application's `config.clj` file. There are two ways to do this...
          1. *If you have not modified your `config.clj`: Generate a new
             application with the same name as your existing application, and
             steal the `config.edn` file from it.
          2. *If you have changed your `config.clj`, or you're a glutten for
             punishment* perform these steps (looking like
             [this](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/3a09c783dde7bf2b3bd1fd6435ec66f9eafe30d7/app-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_app/config/config.edn)
             is our goal):
              1. `mv config/config.clj config/config.edn`
              2. Remove the `ns` declaration.
              3. Unwrap the `configs` def into a raw map.
              4. At path `[:build :watch-files]`,
                 `(compile/html-files-in "app/templates")` should become a map
                 of tags to regex pattern strings like
                 `{:html ["^app/templates"]}`. Note these are **string** regex
                 patterns, not regexps--regexps aren't supported by EDN.
              5. At path `[:build :triggers]`, existing strings should be
                 converted to string regex patterns. For example, the original
                 `{:html ["project-name/rendering.js"]}` would become
                 `{:html ["project-name//rendering\\.js$"]}`.
  
* Tooling's `cljs-repl` is now provided by Chas Emerick's [Piggieback](https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback).
* Tooling's `cljs-repl` is now more clear about usage. This fixes [#93](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/93), [#90](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/90).

### Service

* Service now uses [Cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire)
  instead of [clojure.data.json]() for constructing
  [`json-response`s](../1eeff6a56c20a4cb617148a7d2f22773d0e640ee/service/src/io/pedestal/service/http.clj#L49)
  and [parsing json
  bodies](../1eeff6a56c20a4cb617148a7d2f22773d0e640ee/service/src/io/pedestal/service/http/body_params.clj#L79).

  This change *does* eliminate some JSON parsing options that were previously
  possible in 0.1.10. Specifically the following options are no longer supported:

    * `:eof-error?` - "If true (default) will throw exception if the stream is empty."
    * `:eof-value` - "Object to return if the stream is empty and eof-error? is false. Default is nil."

  If your application makes use of these options you will need to construct a
  `body-params` interceptor with a `parser-map` where you have swapped in your
  own `#"^application/json"` key with a `custom-json-parser` similar to the [old
  version](../7d9d3a028b9529963ec1f46633ef10a73054d140/service/src/io/pedestal/service/http/body_params.clj#L78).

  That might look something like this:

    ```clojure
    ;; In a utility namespace
    (require '[io.pedestal.service.http.body-params :as bp])
    (defn old-style-json-parser ...)

    (def my-body-params (bp/body-params (-> (bp/default-parser-map)
                                            (assoc #"^application/json" (old-style-json-parser)))))
    ```

* The default behavior of the `body-params` interceptor now keywordizes JSON
  keys. To retain the old behavior, create a `body-params` interceptor like so:

    ```clojure
    (require '[io.pedestal.service.http.body-params :as bp])
    (def string-keys-body-params (bp/body-params (bp/default-parser-map :json-options {:key-fn nil})))
    ```
