# Pedestal Changelog

**NOTE:** Whenever upgrading versions of Pedestal, please be sure to clean your project's `out` or `target` directory.

## 0.8.0 - UNRELEASED

*OVERVIEW:*

- Routing
    - New Sawtooth router favors literal paths over those with path parameters, and can report any routing conflicts
    - WebSocket upgrade requests now go through routing, the same as any other endpoint (previously handled as special case)
    - Static files (file system or on JVM classpath) now also go through routing (previously handled via interceptors)
- Servlet Support
    - Upgraded to Jetty 12
- Non-Servlet Support
    - Pedestal APIs that require Jakarta Servlet APIs are now in a new module, io.pedestal/pedestal.servlet
    - Pedestal now supports non-servlet based HTTP libraries, such as [Http-Kit](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit)
- Developer Experience
    - `io.pedestal.http` replaced with simpler, streamlined `io.pedestal.connector`
    - Improved REPL-oriented development, compatible with [clj-reload](https://github.com/tonsky/clj-reload)
    - New `definterceptor` to create a record type that can be used as an interceptor
    - Significant improvements to all documentation

*BREAKING CHANGES:*
- Clojure 1.11 is now the minimum supported version
- The new Sawtooth router is now the *default router*
- Anonymous interceptors are deprecated
- Many APIs deprecated in Pedestal 0.7.0 have been removed outright
- The `io.pedestal/pedestal.service-tools` library has been removed
- Significant changes to `io.pedestal.http.route` have occurred
- Fix reloading behavior when namespaces are reloaded via [clj-reload](https://github.com/tonsky/clj-reload)
- Server-Sent Events have been changed; fields are now terminated with a single `\n` rather than a `\r\n` (both
  are acceptible according to the SSE specification)
- `io.pedestal.test` has been rewritten, nearly from scratch
    - The Servlet API mocks are now standard Java classes, not `reify`-ed classes
    - A request body may now be a java.io.File
- `io.pedestal.http.servlet`
    - The `reify`'ed `FnServlet` class is now a standard Java class, `io.pedestal.servlet.FnServlet`
    - The new `FnServlet` extends `HttpServlet` not `Servlet`
- Deleted deprecated namespaces:
    - `io.pedestal.http.request`
    - `io.pedestal.http.request.lazy`
    - `io.pedestal.http.request.zerocopy`
- Deleted vars (previously deprecated):
    - `io.pedestal.http`
        - `json-print`
    - `io.pedestal.http.body-params`
        - `add-ring-middleware`
        - `edn-parser`
        - `json-parser`
        - `transit-parser`
    - `io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares`
        - `response-fn-adapter`
    - `io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor`
        - `stylobate`
        - `terminator-injector`
- Other deleted vars and namespaces:
    - `io.pedestal.http.route.definition/symbol->keyword`
    - `io.pedestal.http.route.definition/capture-constraint`
    - `io.pedestal.http.request.servlet-support`

Newly deprecated namespaces (these may be removed or made non-public in the future):
- `io.pedestal.jetty.container`
- `io.pedestal.jetty.util`
- `io.pedestal.http`

Other changes:
- A new router, `io.pedestal.http.route.sawtooth`, has been added
    - Sawtooth identifies conflicting routes
    - Sawtooth prefers literal routes over routes with path parameters (i.e., `/users/search` vs. `/users/:id`)
- Metrics can now be configured to accept longs or doubles as their values.
- _Pedestal Connectors_ are a new abstraction around an HTTP library such as Jetty or Http-Kit; connectors
  do not use the Servlet API, and so are much lighter weight
- The `io.pedestal.connector` namespace is used to configure and start a Pedestal connector
    - `io.pedestal.connector.servlet` and new Java class ConnectorServlet allow for WAR deployments
- WebSockets are now routable using new function `io.pedestal.websocket/upgrade-request-to-websocket`
- The `pedestal.service` module has been broken up; all the parts specific to the Jakarta Servlet API are
  now in the `pedestal.servlet` module
- Table routes may now specify :interceptors (in the options map); these are prefixed on any
  interceptors provided by the routes in the table
- Table routes may now include application-defined key/value pairs
- The first argument to `io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table/table-routes` may now be nil or a map
- It is now possible to specify the maximum number of concurrent threads with the Jetty HTTP2 and HTTP2C connection factories
- Deprecation warnings may now be suppressed
- New functions and macros:
    - `io.pedestal.test/create-responder` - useful piece needed in most tests
    - `io.pedestal.interceptor/definterceptor` - easily create component records that transform into interceptors
    - `io.pedestal.log/log` - logs with level determined at runtime
- New namespaces:
    - `io.pedestal.connector` - Replaces `io.pedestal.http` for setting up a connector
    - `io.pedestal.service.protocols` - Defines core protocols
    - `io.pedestal.service.resources` - Expose resources using _routes_ not _interceptors_
    - `io.pedestal.connector.dev` - Development/debugging tools
    - `io.pedestal.service.interceptors` - Common interceptors
    - `io.pedestal.connector.test` - Testing w/ Ring request and response (no Servlet API)
    - `io.pedestal.connector.servlet` - bridge to Pedestal from a WAR deployment
- When converting a handler function to an Interceptor
    - Handler functions may now be *asynchronous*, returning a channel that conveys the response
    - The :name metadata on the _function_ will be used as the :name of the interceptor
    - Otherwise, a :name is derived from the function's class
    - Previously, with the terse or verbose routing specifications, the route name would overwrite the (missing) name
      of the interceptor; now interceptors always have names and this does not occur
    - Extracting default interceptor names from handlers can also be turned off, reverting to 0.7.x behavior
- The `io.pedestal.http.cors/allow-origin` interceptor now, by default, logs at level debug (was level info previously)
- Development mode is now configured as with other values, rather than strictly via a JVM system property

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/milestone/19?closed=1)

## 0.7.0 - 2 Jul 2024

This release marks significant improvements to Pedestal, while laying the cornerstones for further improvements.
The primary focus has been upgrading from Jetty 9 to Jetty 11 (and from Servlet API 3.1 to 5); much additional effort
has been invested in improving the developer experience, rewriting support for application observability,
enhancements to performance, deprecation of unused (or unsupported) code, as well as an intense focus on documentation improvements.

Although this release does include unavoidable breaking changes, we hope that for most applications, the upgrade process will
be as simple as changing the version number. Applications that made direct use of Jetty APIs, or servlet APIs (using the javax.servlet namespace),
will require additional scrutiny to upgrade, as will applications that make extensive use of the (now deprecated)
observability functions provided by the io.pedestal/pedestal.log library.

*BREAKING CHANGES:*

- Library pedestal.jetty has been upgraded from Jetty 9 to Jetty 11
- Library pedestal.immutant has been removed
- Library pedestal.tomcat has been removed
- Library pedestal.aws has been removed
- Namespace `io.pedestal.http.jetty.websockets` has been removed, and replaced with `io.pedestal.http.websockets`
- Namespace `io.pedestal.interceptor.error` has been moved to a new library, io.pedestal/pedestal.error
- Library pedestal.service no longer has a dependency on org.clojure/core.match; the new pedestal.error library has that dependency
- Interceptors that attach an invalid :response value (not a map, for example) will now cause an exception to be thrown
- Interceptors may now attach a partial :response map, containing just a :status key

Other changes:
- When using `io.pedestal.http/dev-interceptors`, uncaught exceptions are now formatted using [org.clj-commons/pretty](https://github.com/clj-commons/pretty) in the response sent to the client
- Pedestal is now compatible with Clojure 1.10.1 and above
- In `io.pedestal.interceptor.chain`:
    - New macros `bind` and `unbind` make it easier for interceptors to manipulate dynamic variables exposed to following interceptors
    - New function `on-enter-async` is used to register a callback invoked when execution first goes asynchronous
    - New function `queue` is used to peek at what interceptors remain on the queue
    - New function `add-observer` to add a callback after each interceptor executes in each stage
- New function `io.pedestal.interceptor.chain.debug/debug-observer` to observe and log changes to the context made by interceptors
- New function `io.pedestal.http/enable-debug-interceptor-observer` to setup `debug-observer`
- New service map keys have been introduced:
    - Support handling of uncaught exceptions
    - May now specify an initial context map
    - May now specify an interceptor responsible for request tracing
- There is now a clojure.spec specification for the structure of the service map, and for the structure of the different route specifications and the expanded routing table
- Added a deps-new template, io.pedestal/embedded, for creating a new Pedestal project around embedded Jetty
- Use of many deprecated functions and macros now cause deprecation warnings to be printed to stderr
- Metrics and tracing have been reimplemented from the ground up around [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
- Libraries pedestal.log and pedestal.error contain [clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo) configuration files to inform clj-kondo about their macros
- New function `io.pedestal.http/respond-with` to streamline adding a :response to the interceptor context
- Easier application configuration: logger, metrics, and tracing configuration can occur inside a `pedestal-config.edn` file (or `pedestal-test-config.edn` for tests), as well as via JVM system properties and environment variables
- Improvements to REPL-based development, including printing the expanded routing table at startup (when in development mode)

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/milestone/12?closed=1)

## 0.6.4 -- 14 May 2024

This release is just to provide dependency upgrades to address CVEs in Jetty and Clojure.

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/milestone/16?closed=1)

## 0.6.3 -- 30 Nov 2023

A change has been made to the `path-params-decoder` to address the breaking change in 0.6.0; by
making the decoder idempotent, it is no longer a breaking change.

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/milestone/15?closed=1)

## 0.6.2 - 17 Nov 2023

Upgrade dependencies to fix CVEs in Jetty.

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/milestone/14?closed=1)

## 0.6.1 - 03 Oct 2023

Upgrade dependencies to fix CVEs:

 * aws-java-sdk-xray
 * jetty (various)
 * tomcat-embed-jasper & tomcat-embed-core

## 0.6.0 - 12 Jun 2023

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
* Path parameters (extracted during routing) are now, by default, URL decoded (via
  `io.pedestal.http.route/path-params-decoder`), when using `io.pedestal.http/default-interceptors`; previously
  this was the application's responsibility, usually in individual routes' interceptor lists.
  The prior behavior can be restored by passing `:io.pedestal.http/path-params-decoder` as nil in the service map
  provided to `io.pedestal.http/create-server`.
* Pedestal now requires JDK 11 or later

Other changes:
* Pedestal is now built using deps (`deps.edn`) rather than Leiningen (`project.clj`)
* Updated many dependencies, particularly to address CVEs in dependencies
* Improvements to documentation and examples

[Closed Issues](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/milestone/11?closed=1)

## 0.5.10 - January 12, 2022

This aligns Pedestal's OpenTracing support with OpenTracing version 0.33. Affected implementations should be changed to interact with spans directly, as per the Pedestal Tracing sample, as opposed to going through the Scope instance. Resolves [#693](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/693)
* Adds a missing arity to TraceOrigin/-span for nils. [#686](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/686)

* Fix FileChannel/open usage in `fast-resource`. Resolves [#651](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/651).
* Clearer error messaging when the AWS XRay tracer is not registered. [#617](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/617).
* Fix error suppression bug. See PR [#645](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/645).
* Use openjdk Docker image in service template. Resolves [#642](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/642).
* The test ServletHttpRequest now returns a StringBuffer on getRequestURL.
* Fix override-logger usage in `log` function. Resolves [#638](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/651).

* Resolves Pedestal dependencies have CVEs of high/critical severity [#619](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/619)
* It is now possible to override the service configuration's  HttpConfiguration (jetty only) [#615](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/615).
* The `url-for` `:strict-path-params?` option is now more strict. Nil values are not allowed. Addresses [#602](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/602).
* Bumped dependencies (see PR [#620](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/620) for details).

## 0.5.5 - December 18, 2018

## 0.2.1 - September 1, 2013

Small bug fix for app-template.

For a full list of changes, please see this comparison of [0.2.0...0.2.1](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/compare/0.2.0...0.2.1).

## 0.2.0 - August 30, 2013

This is a big one folks. Developer tooling has moved from generated projects into
the app- and service-tools libraries.

**If you want to take advantage of all the super-awesome new features then further action is required.**
See the respective changelogs in App and Service for more info.

### App

* Developer tooling has moved in its entirety to app-tools.

  Notable improvements:
    * Tooling functions are automatically included when running `lein repl`.
    * App configuration can be reloaded with `(reload-config)`
    * Future upgrades to tooling will be incorporated more easily.

  Additionally, app configuration is specified by an EDN file (instead of an
  executable Clojure file.) New projects will make use of this feature, but
  pre-0.2.0 generated projects will not.

  **You do not *have* to make this upgrade, but we *suggest* you do.**

  The easiest way to upgrade is to re-generate your application with the 0.2.0
  app-template and transfer your existing code into it. It is possible, however,
  to migrate your existing application.

  **How to migrate a 0.1.x project to 0.2.0:**
      1. Upgrade your project's pedestal-app dependencies to version `"0.2.0"`
      2. Remove the `dev/` folder.
      3. `$ touch config/user.clj` -- This is needed for `:repl-options` with `:init user` to work.
      4. Update your `project.clj`'s `:main` and `:repl-options` keys [like so](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/4a148bf23c255baee420d7b725677b98de325120/app-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_app/project.clj#L14-L23).
      5. Add the [piggieback dependency](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/4a148bf23c255baee420d7b725677b98de325120/app-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_app/project.clj#L9) to your `project.clj` (`[com.cemerick/piggieback "0.1.0"]`).
      6. Update your application's `config.clj` file. There are two ways to do this...
          1. *If you have not modified your `config.clj`: Generate a new
             application with the same name as your existing application, and
             steal the `config.edn` file from it.
          2. *If you have changed your `config.clj`, or you're a glutten for
             punishment* perform these steps (looking like
             [this](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/4a148bf23c255baee420d7b725677b98de325120/app-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_app/config/config.edn)
             is our goal):
              1. `mv config/config.clj config/config.edn`
              2. Remove the `ns` declaration.
              3. Unwrap the `configs` def into a raw map.
              4. Remove quotes from quoted namespaces. Look in :main and :renderer keys.
              5. At path `[:build :watch-files]`,
                 `(compile/html-files-in "app/templates")` should become a map
                 of tags to regex pattern strings like
                 `{:html ["^app/templates"]}`. Note these are **string** regex
                 patterns, not regexps--regexps aren't supported by EDN.
              6. At path `[:build :triggers]`, existing strings should be
                 converted to string regex patterns. For example, the original
                 `{:html ["project-name/rendering.js"]}` would become
                 `{:html ["project-name//rendering\\.js$"]}`.

* Tooling's `cljs-repl` is now provided by Chas Emerick's [Piggieback](https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback).
* Tooling's `cljs-repl` is now more clear about usage. This fixes [#93](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/93), [#90](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/90).
* App's ClojureScript dependency has been bumped to r1835. Namespaced keywords are now allowed (`::msg/topic`)!
* Logging in the browser is now grouped. [#95](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/95)
* The template now includes a `:ui` aspect for rendering the `simulated` behavior. [#184](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/184), [#187](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/187)
* Added the `:read-as` option for `msg/param`. Setting to `:data` causes collected values to be parsed by the Clojure reader. [#166](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/166)*

### Service

* Service tooling has moved out of generated projects into a service-tools library.

  Notable improvements:

  * Tooling functions are automatically included when running `lein repl`.
  * Future upgrades to tooling will be incorporated more easily.

  There is a bit of migration necessary to move existing projects to 0.2.0 tooling.
  **You don't *have* to make this change, but we *suggest* you do**.

  **How to migrate a 0.1.x project to 0.2.0:**
      1. Update your project's dependencies to match the [new ones](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/0.2.0/service-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_service/project.clj):
         1. Upgrade your project's pedestal-service dependencies to version `"0.2.0"`.
         2. Add `[io.pedestal/pedestal.service-tools "0.2.0"]` as a dependency.
         3. Remove logback and slf4j logging dependencies.
      2. Remove the `dev/` folder
      3. `$ touch config/user.clj` -- This is needed for `:repl-options` with `:init user` to work.
      4. Update your `project.clj`'s `:main` and `:repl-options` keys to match
         [the new template project.clj](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/4a148bf23c255baee420d7b725677b98de325120/service-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_service/project.clj#L18-L32).
      5. Pare down your src/**/server.clj file to match
         [the new template server.clj](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/4a148bf23c255baee420d7b725677b98de325120/service-template/src/leiningen/new/pedestal_service/server.clj).

* Service now uses [Cheshire](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire)
  instead of [clojure.data.json](https://github.com/clojure/data.json) for constructing
  [`json-response`s](../1eeff6a56c20a4cb617148a7d2f22773d0e640ee/service/src/io/pedestal/service/http.clj#L49)
  and [parsing json
  bodies](../1eeff6a56c20a4cb617148a7d2f22773d0e640ee/service/src/io/pedestal/service/http/body_params.clj#L79). [#162](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/162)

  **This change *does* eliminate some JSON parsing options that were previously
  possible in 0.1.10.** Specifically the following options are no longer supported:

    * `:eof-error?` - "If true (default) will throw exception if the stream is empty."
    * `:eof-value` - "Object to return if the stream is empty and eof-error? is false. Default is nil."

  If your application makes use of these options you will need to construct a
  `body-params` interceptor with a `parser-map` where you have swapped in your
  own `#"^application/json"` key with a `custom-json-parser` similar to the [old
  version](../7d9d3a028b9529963ec1f46633ef10a73054d140/service/src/io/pedestal/service/http/body_params.clj#L78).

  That might look something like this:

    ```clojure
    ;; In a utility namespace
    (require '[io.pedestal.service.http.body-params :as bp])
    (defn old-style-json-parser ...)

    (def my-body-params (bp/body-params (-> (bp/default-parser-map)
                                            (assoc #"^application/json" (old-style-json-parser)))))
    ```

* The default behavior of the `body-params` interceptor now keywordizes JSON
  keys. To retain the old behavior, create a `body-params` interceptor like so:

    ```clojure
    (require '[io.pedestal.service.http.body-params :as bp])
    (def string-keys-body-params (bp/body-params (bp/default-parser-map :json-options {:key-fn nil})))
    ```
* A bug with CORS headers has been fixed.
* The default MIME type has been returned to text/plain (it was a bug that it changed to octet-stream.)
