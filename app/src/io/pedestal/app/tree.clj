    "A tree structure which can be used to represent the user
     interface of an application.

    A tree node may contain a value, attributes and data model
    transformations.

    Values are arbitrary Clojure data.

    Attributes are a map of keys to values.

    Data model transformations are maps of transform names to
    collections of messages which can transform the data model.

    The purpose of this tree is to provide an information model for an
    application. This model contains all of the information that is
    required to render a user interface without including information
    about how to render it."
