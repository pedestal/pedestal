= Prefix Tree Router

== Motivation

Provide a performant router which is efficient in time and
space.

The implementation is modeled after link:https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter[httprouter], a library for Go.

== Why use it?

Most performant builtin router implementation when dynamic routes (those using path
parameters and wildcards) are required. The prefix tree router operates in logarithmic time.

== How to use it?

Add the key `:io.pedestal.http/router` to the service map with the
value `:prefix-tree`.

== Caveats

Provides less control over routing. For example, Wild card routes
always win. The path `/foo/:bar` will always match over `/foo/baz`.

== Additional Notes

Like the xref:map-tree-router.adoc[], query and path
constraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.
