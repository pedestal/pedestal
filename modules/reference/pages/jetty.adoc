= Jetty Configuration and Deployment

link:https://eclipse.dev/jetty/[Jetty] is the default container used with Pedestal.

[NOTE]
Prior to Pedestal 0.7, there was also support for Tomcat and Immutant, but the Pedestal team has decided to focus efforts
on Jetty, as it is used by the vast majority of Pedestal applications.
