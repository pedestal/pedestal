= Map Tree Router

== Motivation

Many Pedestal-based services do not leverage every routing
feature. The Map Tree router is optimized for the _static routes_ use
case.

== Why use it?

Routes requests in constant time (path matching is done by map
lookup).

== How to use it?

No need to do anything. This is Pedestal's default router implementation.

== Caveats

While this is Pedestal's default router, it falls back to the
link:prefix-tree-router[Prefix Tree router] when path parameters or
wildcards are used in routes.

== Additional Notes

Like the link:prefix-tree-router[Prefix Tree Router], query and path
contraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.
