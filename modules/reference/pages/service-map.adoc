= Service Map

The service map is a blueprint that Pedestal uses to create all the necessary
parts to begin processing requests: a service function, server function, chain provider, router, routes, and
default set of interceptors.

[NOTE]
.Server vs. Service
--
A _server_ is just the part of the overall system that listens for requests and sends responses; it's
the part most closely tied to your underlying servlet container (Jetty, Tomcat, and so forth).
The _service_ runs the show: it's the server plus everything else: chain provider, the interceptors
(including those responsible for routing), and so forth.
--

An application creates the service map and passes it to
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-server[`create-server`].
The result is a _server_ map that is ready to be started.

Keep in mind, however, that this is strictly a convenience function
that assembles the parts for you. There are use cases where you would
not call `create-server`, but instead assemble a service function,
chain provider, and so forth, directly.
See the chain provider link:../samples/index[sample].

Pedestal may add other keys to this map for its own use. Other applications
should treat any such keys and their values as implementation details
and their behaviour will remain unspecified.

NOTE: In the details below, `::http` is an alias to `:io.pedestal.http`.

[cols="s,d,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Always present? | Type | Description

| `::http/allowed-origins`
| N
| Function, map, or sequence of strings
| Determines which origins are allowed for the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.cors.html#var-allow-origin[`cors/allow-origin`] interceptor. See "CORS" below.

| `::http/chain-provider`
| N
| Function
| Only assigned when replacing the link:servlet-interceptor[servlet interceptor]. Receives the service-map, returns a service-map with whatever additional pieces the server function expects. (See `::http/type`, below.)

| `::http/container-options`
| N
| Map
| Map of options to pass to the container. See link:index#_deployment_and_operations[Deployment and Operations] for container-specific options.

| `::http/enable-csrf`
| N
| Map
| A settings map to pass to the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.csrf.html#var-anti-forgery[`csrf/anti-forgery`] interceptor. See CSRF below.

| `::http/enable-session`
| N
| Map
| A settings map to pass to the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-session[`ring-middlewares/session`] interceptor. Settings are session-store specific. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| `::http/file-path`
| N
| String
| File path used as root by the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-file[`ring-middlewares/file`] interceptor. If non-`nil`, this interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| `::http/host`
| N
| String
| Hostname, e.g., "localhost". Passed to the container. Defaults to `localhost` footnote:[
`localhost` is a safe default and works with local testing, as your test code will be on the same
host as the server. However, *only* connections originating on the local host will be accepted.
For production deployments, however, you will usually set this to be `0.0.0.0`, which
accepts connections from anywhere.  This is especially true when running
Pedestal inside a Docker container, as all connections (even those from the host, or
from another container on the same host) will be network, not localhost, connections.].

| `::http/interceptors`
| N
| Vector
| Vector of items that satisfy link:../api/io.pedestal.interceptor.html#var-IntoInterceptor[`interceptor/IntoInterceptor`]. No additional interceptors are added if this key is non-`nil`. The default interceptors are defined by the service map options and link:../api/io.pedestal.http.html#var-default-interceptors[`http/default-interceptors`].

| `::http/join?`
| N
| Boolean
| If `false`, do not block the thread that starts the web server. Passed to the container.

| `::http/method-param-name`
| N
| Keyword
| Query string parameter used to set the current HTTP verb. Default is `:_method`.

| `::http/mime-types`
| N
| Map of String -> String
| Mime-types map used by the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-content-type[`ring-middlewares/content-type`] interceptor. Default is `{}`.

| `::http/not-found-interceptor`
| N
| Interceptor
| Interceptor to use when returning a 404 Not Found response. Default is the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.html#var-not-found[`http/not-found`] interceptor.


| `::http/port`
| N
| Integer
| Port for the running server. If `nil`, Pedestal defaults to port 80 and HTTP.

| `::http/resource-path`
| N
| string
| File path used as root by the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares.html#var-resource[`ring-middlewares/resource`] interceptor. If non-`nil`, the interceptor is added. Default is `nil`.

| `::http/router`
| N
| Keyword or route constructor
| The router implementation to use. Can be `:linear-search`, `:map-tree` `:prefix-tree`, or a custom link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.router.html#var-Router[`router/Router`] constructor function. Defaults to `:map-tree`, which falls back to `:prefix-tree`.

| `::http/routes`
| Y
| Function, `ExpandableRoutes`, or sequence of maps
| Something that satisfies the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-ExpandableRoutes[`route/ExpandableRoutes`] protocol, a function that returns routes when called, or a seq of route maps that defines a service's routes. If passing in a seq of route maps, it's recommended to use link:../api/io.pedestal.http.route.html#var-expand-routes[`route/expand-routes`] as the full route map contains some redundancies to make processing easier which `expand-routes` adds automatically.

| `::http/secure-headers`
| N
| map of keyword -> string
| A settings map for various secure headers. See "Secure Headers" below

| `::http/service-fn`
| N
| function
| A function which can be used as an implementation of the `jakarta.servlet.Servlet.service` method. The function is defined by link:../api/io.pedestal.http.html#var-create-server[`http/create-server`].

| `::http/servlet`
| N
| `jakarta.servlet.Servlet`
| Present if the servlet is running.

| `::http/start-fn`
| N
| function
| Zero-arity function that starts the server.

| `::http/stop-fn`
| N
| function
| Zero-arity function that stops the server.

| `::http/type`
| Y
| Keyword or Function
| Container for service or server function. As a keyword, names the container - currently, only :jetty is supported out of the box.
As a function, acts as the server function.

== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

If the `::http/allowed-origins` key is non-`nil`, the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.cors.html#var-allow-origin[allow-origin]
interceptor is added. The default is `nil`.

The allowed values are:

- a function of one argument that returns a truthy value when an origin is allowed;
- a map containing the following keys and values `:allowed-origins` sequence of strings or a function, `:creds` boolean indicating whether the client is allowed to send credentials, `:max-age` a long indicating the number of seconds a client should cache the response, and :methods, indicating the accepted HTTP methods, defaulting to "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, OPTIONS";
- a sequence of strings matching the the scheme, host and port (`scheme://host:port`) of allowed origins.

== Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

When a value for `::http/enable-csrf` is present, the
link:../api/io.pedestal.http.csrf.html#var-anti-forgery[anti-forgery]
interceptor is added to the queue. This implies that support for HTTP sessions are enabled (Pedestal will add the
necessary interceptor automatically).

The value must be a map with the following keys:

|===
| Key | Value type | Description

| `:read-token`
| Function
| This function takes a request and returns an anti-forgery token or `nil` if the token does not exist.

| `:cookie-token`
| any
| truthy value for CSRF double-submit cookies

| `:error-response`
| Function
| This function takes the response body and returns a 403 Not Authorized response

| `:error-handler`
| Function
| This function takes the context and returns the appropriate response.

|===

Only one of `:error-response` or `:error-handler` may be specified.

=== Secure Headers

When the `::http/secure-headers` value is present and non-`nil`, the link:../api/io.pedestal.http.secure-headers.html#var-secure-headers[`secure-headers/secure-headers`] interceptor is added.

If the key is simply not present in the service map, then a set of default secure headers will be provided:

|===
| Key | HTTP Header | Content

| `:hsts-settings`
| Strict-Transport-Security
| "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains"

| `:frame-options-settings`
| X-Frame-Options
| "DENY"

| `:content-type-settings`
| X-Content-Type-Options
| "nosniff"

| `:xss-protection-settings`
| X-XSS-Protection
| "1; mode=block"

| `:download-options-settings`
| X-Download-Options
| "noopen"

| `:cross-domain-policies-settings`
| X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies
| "none"

| `:content-security-policy-settings`
| Content-Security-Policy
| "object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;"

|===

If the value for `::http/secure-headers` is present, it may contain
keys and string values for the security headers. Any other keys will be ignored.
