;; Two notes:

;; 1. Storing session data requires specifying the session store
;; in the map. (e.g. `{:store (cookie/cookie-store)}` If :store
;; is not specified, the session data will not be stored.

;; 2: In this example code we do not specify the secret with which the
;; session data is encrypted prior to being sent back to the
;; browser. As a result, the same interceptor instance must be used
;; through the service for the data to be readable and writable. Also,
;; the session data will become unrecoverable when the server process
;; ends. While the browser retains the cookie, the interceptor will
;; treat the unrecoverable ciphertext as non-existent.

;; Set up routes to get all the above handlers accessible.
