;; Two notes:

;; 1: You can create a session interceptor without specifying a store,
;; in which case the interceptor will store the session data nowhere
;; and it will be about as useful as not having it in the first
;; place. Storing session data requires specifying the session store.

;; 2: In this example code we do not specify the secret with which the
;; session data is encrypted prior to being sent back to the
;; browser. This has two consequences, the first being that we need to
;; use the same interceptor instance throughout the service so that the
;; session data is readable and writable to all paths. The second
;; consequence is that session data will become unrecoverable when the
;; server process is ended. Even though the browser retains the
;; cookie, it is not unrecoverable ciphertext and the session
;; interceptor will treat it as non-existant.
