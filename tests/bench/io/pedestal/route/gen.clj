  "Generate routes and requests for a given set of routes.

  Why not use an existing generative library? A valid set of routes
  follows a very specific set of rules which is hard to encode in a
  generic generative library. It may not be impossible but it was
  faster to write this.

  Not much effort has gone into making this fast."
