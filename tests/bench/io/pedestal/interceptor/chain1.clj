  An Interceptor is record with the keys :enter,

  keys or nil values are ignored. When executing a context, first all
  the :enter functions are invoked in order. As this happens, the
  Interceptors are pushed on to a stack.  Interceptor may also have a :name,
  which is used when logging.

  When execution reaches the end of the queue, it begins popping
  Interceptors off the stack and calling their :leave functions.
  Therefore :leave functions are called in the opposite order from
  :enter functions.

  Both the :enter and :leave functions are passed a single
  argument, the context map, and return an updated context.

  If any Interceptor function throws an exception, execution stops and
  begins popping Interceptors off the stack and calling their :error
  functions. The :error function takes two arguments: the context and
  an exception. It may either handle the exception, in which case the
  execution continues with the next :leave function on the stack; or
  re-throw the exception, passing control to the :error function on
  the stack. If the exception reaches the end of the stack without
  being handled, execute will throw it

  Functions may return a core.async channel; this represents an
  asynchronous process.  When this happens, the initial call to
  execute returns nil immediately, with the process exepected to write
  an updated context into the channel when its work completes.

  The function [[on-enter-async]] is used to provide a callback for
  when an interceptor chain execution first switches from in-thread to
  asynchronous execution.

  Processing continues in core.async threads - including even when
  a later interceptor returns an immediate context, rather than

  :context-out      | map               | The context returned from the interceptor

  The observer is only invoked for interceptor _executions_; when an interceptor does not provide a callback
  for a stage, the interceptor is not invoked, and so the observer is not invoked.

  The value returned by the observer is ignored.

  If an observer throws an exception, it is associated with the interceptor, exactly as if the interceptor
  had thrown the exception.

  When multiple observer functions are added, they are invoked in an unspecified order.

  The [[debug-observer]] function is used to create an observer function; this observer
  can be used to log each interceptor that executes, in what phase it executes,
  and how it modifies the context map.."
  [context observer-fn]
  (update context ::observer-fn merge-observer observer-fn))
