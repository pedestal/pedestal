	<p>somewhere i have never travelled, gladly beyond<br/>any experience,your eyes have their silence:<br/>in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,<br/>or which i cannot touch because they are too near<br/><br/>your slightest look easily will unclose me<br/>though i have closed myself as fingers,<br/>you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens<br/>(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose<br/><br/>or if your wish be to close me, i and<br/>my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly,<br/>as when the heart of this flower imagines<br/>the snow carefully everywhere descending;<br/><br/>nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals<br/>the power of your intense fragility:whose texture<br/>compels me with the color of its countries,<br/>rendering death and forever with each breathing<br/><br/>(i do not know what it is about you that closes<br/>and opens;only something in me understands<br/>the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)<br/>nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands</p>
	<p>&mdash; E. E. Cummings</p>
