= Chain Providers

Pedestal uses a chain of xref:interceptors.adoc[] to process incoming HTTP requests and provide outgoing HTTP responses.
However, the underlying code - the interceptors and the interceptor chain that executes them - is more general.

Interceptor chains can be used for a variety of operations, such as:

- Processing messages from a queue, such as Kafka or JMS
- Performing a series of transformations on documents as part of a publishing service
- Processing outgoing requests and incoming responses from a back-end service

A _chain provider_ is responsible for accepting an incoming stimuli (such as an incoming HTTP request)
and setting up a xref:context-map.adoc[] and initial interceptors to process that stimuli.
The service map is processed via the
api:execute[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain] function.

Part of a chain provider's responsibility is to identify when a request has been processed; for
HTTP requests, this is when a handler or some other interceptor attaches a :response map to the context map.

Pedestal itself only provides a chain provider implementation for incoming HTTP request processing,
in the form of the xref:servlet-interceptor.adoc[].

Essentially, the chain provider configures the interceptor chain and answers the following questions:

- When does the chain terminate early (for HTTP, when the :response key is attached)
- What interceptors execute (some provided by the provider, the rest provided by the application)
- What happens when execution first goes asynchronous (because an interceptor returns a {core_async} channel)?
