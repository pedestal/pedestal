= Routing Quick Reference
::default_api_ns: io.pedestal.http.route

_Routing_ is the process by which an incoming request is analyzed to determine how it
will be processed by Pedestal.

Routing is based on comparing any of a number of factors from the request, including:

- The request path (including matching wild cards in the path)
- The HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.)
- The HTTP scheme used in the request (http or https)
- The name of host in the request
- The port number

It's natural to understand why path and method are involved in routing; less obvious for
the other factors. Essentially, a single Pedestal application may host two or more concurrent
sets of endpoints inside the same server - incoming requests are differentiated most often by port, but
can also be differentiated by the host.  A somewhat common example is an outward-facing consumer
application exposed outside a company's firewall on one port, and an inward-facing set of endpoints
for operations (status, metrics, management, and so forth) on a different port.

[WARNING]
====
Defining routes and setting up the servlet container are two separate functions; just because you have
a route mapped to a port or host doesn't mean that the servlet container is configured to accept
requests for that port or host. You have to connect those dots by setting up the servlet container's
configuration in the xref:connector-map.adoc[] (or xref:service-map.adoc[]).

== Library

The library api:*[] namespace
provides the core components to express routes and construct
routers. It can be used independently of the pedestal-service library.

== Route Specifications vs. Routing Functions vs. Routing Interceptor

Pedestal is data driven, and the routing information starts in one form (as data) and is then
transformed in a couple of stages to reach a final result that can be used to route incoming requests.

The start is the route specification.
Pedestal has three built-in formats for route specification:
table, terse, and verbose.  Table is the newest format footnote:[But still old - the table format dates back to 2016]
and is the preferred format; the others are maintained for compatibility.

For each of the built-in formats, there is a function that can convert that specific format
into a _routing fragment_. One or more fragments are then combined to form the routing table.

Pedestal will determine which function to invoke based on the kind of data: set, vector, or map:

....

Tab["#{} set"] --> tabr
tabr([table/table-routes]) --> frag
Terse["[] vector"] --> terser
terser([terse/terse-routes]) --> frag
Verb["{}] map"] --> verbr
verbr([terse/map-routes->vec-routes]) --> frag
frag[Routing Fragment] --> expand
expand([expand-routes]) --> table
cons[Router Constructor Fn] --> make-fn
table[Routing Table] -->  make-fn
make-fn([router]) --> intc
intc[Routing Interceptor]
....

_Route specifications_ are the data values that spell out the possible routes.
These are normalized and expanded  and combined into a routing table.  In effect, a routing specification
is a way to avoid calling any of the specific functions, such as
api:table-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route.table]. The end result is equivalent.

The functions convert their inputs into _routing fragments_ which are then combined into a routing _table_ by api:expand-routes[].

A _Router Constructor_ function is passed the routing table, and applies a specific strategy to match incoming requests
to the provided routes; there are a few different constructor functions, each
with different limitations and trade-offs.  The default is Sawtooth (api:router[ns=io.pedestal.http.route.sawtooth]).

The router constructor returns a _Routing function_ encapsulating the routing table and the strategy.

The routing function is passed the request and returns a vector of two values on success: the matching route, then the map
of path parameters.  On failure, the routing function returns nil.

The routing interceptor is built around the routing function; its job
it to combine the routing function and the current request to identify the route, if any,
that matches the request.  When routing is successful, the interceptor updates the
xref:request-map.adoc[], and queues up route-specific interceptors to handle the request.

[TIP]
====
There are actually two different implementations of the interceptor; the production one is used
in the normal case, where the routing table is an actual value.  During development,
the routing table may be a function that returns the routing table; in which case, the routing
function is rebuilt _on every request_.
====

Generally, all of this is automatic; an application provides routes to
the api:with-routes[ns=io.pedestal.connector] function, or provides a route specification in the :io.pedestal.http/route key
of the xref:service-map.adoc[] (and perhaps a value for :io.pedestal.http/router) and a routing
interceptor is automatically created.

== Route Specifications

Route specifications go through a series of transformations that results in a routing table;
a routing table is a sequence of verbose routing maps.

The
api:expand-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
function converts any kind of specification(s) into a routing table:

|===
| Argument to `expand-routes` | Syntax used

| Set
| xref:table-syntax.adoc[] - Most recent (2016), easier than terse format,
  recommended for new projects.

| Vector
| xref:terse-syntax.adoc[] - improvement on the verbose syntax, with an emphasis on avoiding
  redundancy, but can be hard to read and write, since it is expressed as deeply nested maps.

| Map
| xref:verbose-syntax.adoc[] - oldest format.
|===

This mapping from value type to specification type is the responsibility of the
api:ExpandableRoutes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] protocol, which is
extended on Map, Set, and Vector.

TIP: `ExpandableRoutes` is only needed when Pedestal is provided with routes as data (a Set, Vector, or Map)
It is also perfectly valid to build the routes explicitly, by directly
calling api:table-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table].

It's not impossible that your application has specific needs that can't be met by any of the
built-in formats and, as is often the case in Pedestal.
To support a new syntax, come up with a syntax that resolves to new record type that implements the
ExpandableRoutes protocol.

`expand-routes` can be passed any number of routing specifications; these can be a mix of different data
formats, plus the results of directly calling a definition function, such as
`table-routes`.  The routing table is the merged result of all of these.

[#routing-table]
== Routing Table

The expanded routing table is a wrapper object containing a :routes key;
The routes is a seq of routing maps, with the following structure:

[source,clojure]
----
(:routes
    (route/expand-routes
        #{{:app-name :example-app
           :scheme   :https
           :host     "example.com"}
          ["/department/:id/employees" :get [...]
           :route-name :org.example.app/employee-search
           :constraints {:name  #".+"
                         :order #"(asc|desc)"}]}))
=>
({:route-name :org.example.app/employee-search <1>
   :app-name   :example-app  <2>
   :path       "/department/:id/employees" <3>
   :method     :get <4>
   :scheme     :https <5>
   :host       "example.com" <6>
   :port       8080 <7>
   :interceptors [...] <8>

   :path-parts        ["department" :id "employees"] <9>
   :path-params       [:id] <10>
   :path-constraints  {:id #"([^/]+)"}
   :query-constraints {:name #".+"
                       :order #"(asc|desc)"}
   })
----
<1> :route-name is required and must be a keyword; often a qualified keyword. The route name must
    be unique within the table. If omitted, the route name will come from the name of the last interceptor for the route.
<2> Optional, used for documentation only.
<3> Must start with a leading slash; terms with a leading `:` identify _path parameters_, or
    a leading `*` identifies a wildcard.
<4> HTTP method to match against, or :any to match any HTTP method.
<5> Optional for matching, must be :http or :https.
<6> Optional for matching.
<7> Optional for matching.
<8> A vector of interceptors (converted via api:IntoInterceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor])
<9> The parts of the path, as strings or keywords.
<10> The path parameters, in the order they appear in the path.

This ficticious example defines a URI that includes an id in the request path, but has also defined query parameters
constraints.

The :io.pedestal.http.route.specs/routing-table specification exhaustively defines what is allowed in a routing table.

A path parameter will normally match a single name within the path, delimited by `/` characters; an alternate form
is the wildcard, which starts with `*` and is only allowed at the end of the path:  `["/accounts/*ids" :get ...]` would
provide a path parameter named :ids, and will contain anything on the URL after `/accounts/`, including any slashes.

A path parameter must match at least one term, so a URL of just `/accounts` or `/accounts/` would not match the route.

[#builtin]
== Built-in Routers

Pedestal includes several routing algorithms; this reflects not only the evolution of the Pedestal library,
but also allows for different trade-offs in the algorithm used by each Router.  In rare cases, an application
can provide its own router rather than use one of Pedestal's.

When configuring Pedestal using a xref:connector-map.adoc[], the :router key (which defaults to :sawtooth)
is the name of a built-in router constructor function, or a specific router constructor function.

When your application starts a Pedestal service with
api:create-servlet[ns=io.pedestal.http] or
api:create-server[ns=io.pedestal.http],
Pedestal creates a router, using the following keys from the service map:

|===
| Key | Meaning

| :io.pedestal.http/routes | A route specification
| :io.pedestal.http/router | Key to select a router, or a function that constructs a router from a routing table
|===

When the router is specified as a keyword, it selects one of the built-in algorithms:

|===
| Keyword | Router | Performance

| :map-tree
| xref:map-tree-router.adoc[Map Tree]
| Very fast


| :prefix-tree
| xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[Prefix Tree]
| High performance, space efficient

| :sawtooth (default router)
| xref:sawtooth-router.adoc[Sawtooth]
| High performance, better conflict resolution, reports conflicts

| :linear-search
| xref:linear-search-router.adoc[Linear Search]
| Lowest performance

|===

== Routing Interceptor

The function api:router[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] is where it all comes together;
this function is passed the routing table and the router type; from that it creates
the router function, and then, at the end, creates an interceptor that performs routing, which it returns.

During request execution, on a successful routing, the following keys are added in the context map:

|===
| Key / Key Path | Value

| :route | The verbose route map

| [:request :path-params] | Path parameters extracted from the request path

|===

In addition, additional interceptors, specific to the route, will have been
scheduled for execution via the api:enqueue[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain] function.

On failure, when the router does not match any route, the context key :route is set to nil.
