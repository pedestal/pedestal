= Sawtooth Router

== Motivation

Provide a router that can detect and report route conflicts.

== Why use it?

Sawtooth is similar to xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[Prefix Tree] in how it generally operates,
and is nearly as fast -- within 5 to 10%  of prefix-tree in benchmarks, and on the order of a micro- (not milli-)
second to route a request.

Further, when the routing table consists only of static paths (that is, no path parameters), Sawtooth
has performance nearly as fast as xref:map-tree-router.adoc[] (a fraction of a micro-second to route a request).

Sawtooth prioritizes the routes in the routing table. A route path consists of _terms_; either literal strings,
or path parameters, or the wild path parameter.  Generally speaking, a path with literal terms will be matched
before a path with path parameters, and wild path parameter is considered last.

xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[] is less explicit on how it handle potential conflicts, and prefers path parameters
over literal terms, the exact opposite of Sawtooth.

Sawtooth's distinguishing characteristic is that it will, at startup, write (to standard error)
a report describing any conflicting routes.
This gives you, as the developer, feedback about routing problems.

== How to use it?

Sawtooth is the default router; it will be the default for the :router key in the
xref:connector-map.adoc[], or is used as the default when no value for key :io.pedestal.http/router
is provided in the xref:service-map.adoc[].

If you prefer to be explicit, set the value to :sawtooth.

== Caveats

The behavior of Sawtooth is not defined when there _are_ route conflicts;
The prefix-tree allows for route conflicts between static paths and those with path parameters, and silently
prefers the path parameters routes over the static routes.

== Additional Notes

Like the prefix-tree and map-tree routers, query and path
constraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.

Sawtooth's implementation is based on treating the path as a sequence of terms; each term may match a literal value in that
position, shared by one or more routers, or may be a path parameter. This leads to sets of routes that match the same initial term.

Sawtooth always considers the literal term matches first.

For example, consider the following route paths:

- /user/:id
- /user/:id/profile
- /user/search
- /blog/:id

None of these routes are in conflict.  If the request path is `/user/search` it will always match the last route.
If the request path is `/user/12487` is will match the first route.  If the request path is `/user/12487/profile`, Sawtooth will
match the second route - because routes that do not contain the wild-card path paramer must match the exact number of terms.

In terms of operation, Sawtooth will match the first term (say "user"), and will only consider the first three routes,
ignoring the fourth. It is then tasked with matching the request against the literal term `search` (third route),
or it will match a term against `:id` (first route), or match a term  term followed by the literal term `profile` (second route).
It's all about subdivide and conquer.

Alternately, if the request path started with "/blog", only the fourth route would be considered.

Sawtooth is also adaptive to the kinds of routes being matched; primarily, if a term leads to a set of routes that are literal only
(no path parameters), that subset of the tree will be matched the way the xref:map-tree-router.adoc[] operates, which is
much faster.

Routes can define a matching hostname, port, scheme, or request method. Sawtooth effectively subdivides the overall
set of routes based on these values (including the common case where a route responds for any port, any request method, etc.)
Once past these broadly applied filters, Sawtooth spends the bulk of its execution time matching the request path against the various
routes' paths.
