= Servlet Interceptor

The servlet interceptor footnote:[Poorly named, for historical reasons, as it is neither a servlet nor an interceptor, but actually the bridge between the two.] is the bridge between the Java Servlet API and Pedestal's
interceptor chain. It is created when an application calls
api:create-bridge[ns=io.pedestal.connector.servlet]
which is turn calls
calls api:http-interceptor-service-fn[ns=io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor].

This results in a service function that accepts
the servlet, servlet request and servlet response (as defined by the Servlet API)
and executes an interceptor chain, as a xref:chain-providers.adoc[chain provider],
to handle an incoming HTTP request.

The service function performs the following tasks:

   1. Sets up the xref:context-map.adoc[] and xref:request-map.adoc[]
   2. Executes the interceptor queue (:enter, then :leave)
   3. Catches any exceptions that aren't handled by xref:error-handling.adoc[] within the interceptors
   4. Writes the final response, using the xref:response-map.adoc[]

Part of this work is accomplished  by adding new keys to the default context map; beyond
that, additional interceptors are prepended:

== :io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor/stylobate

The stylobate interceptor primarily handles otherwise uncaught
xref:error-handling.adoc[unhandled exceptions] that occur during
interceptor chain execution.

== :io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor/ring-response

Responsible for converting the :response key in the context, when present,
into a response delivered to the client; this may include
xref:streaming.adoc[async streaming].

== Partial Responses

In very rare cases, different interceptors may provide different parts of response.
Ultimately, the response must be a valid Ring response, but it is not uncommon
for one interceptor to, say, rewrite the :body, and another interceptor to set up the `Content-Type` header.

If your application requires this, be very careful about early termination.

1. Put the initial value into the response map in the last :enter
   function, then use the :leave functions to refine that value.
2. Put the initial value into the context under a different key and
   refine that value in either :enter or :leave functions. When
   the response is complete, transfer the response map to the :response key.
