= Request Map
:reftext: request map
:navtitle: Request Map

The request map is attached to the xref:context-map.adoc[]
before the first interceptor is invoked. The request map describes the
incoming HTTP request, including information about the remote
endpoint.

Pedestal does not attach metadata to the request map.

When processing, take care to modify the map (e.g., use `assoc`), rather than constructing
a new map entirely. Interceptors may add arbitrary keys to the request map, and the interceptors' functionality
may depend on getting stored values back out of the request map.

Pedestal uses an extended version of the {ring-spec}:

WARNING: The :servlet, :servlet-request, and :servlet-response will not be present when the created around a xref:connector.adoc[].
They are provided by the xref:servlet-interceptor.adoc[], and so, only available inside a xref:guides:war-deployment.adoc[].

Many more keys are added to the request map by the
xref:default-interceptors.adoc[default interceptors], many of the new keys are related to parsing query parameters and the
request body; this is described more fully in xref:parameters.adoc[the parameters reference].
