= Parameters


HTTP allows clients to provide per-request information through several
mechanisms:

* The request URL
* Query parameters appended to the URL
* Body content

Various xref:interceptors.adoc[interceptors] in Pedestal parse this
information and attach it to the xref:request-map.adoc[].

== Query Parameters

Query parameters will be attached to the xref:request-map.adoc[]
under the key :query-params. The value will be a map, constructed as follows:

* Each query parameter name becomes a key in the map.
* The query parameter name is URL-decoded.
* If the resulting string could be a Clojure keyword, it is converted to a keyword.
* Otherwise, the string itself becomes the key.
* The query parameter value is URL-decoded and attached as the value of that key.

For example, a request string like this:

----
/path/to/resource?after=123123%2099
----

Becomes the map:

[source,clojure]
----
{:after "123123 99"}
----

Whereas, the request string:

----
/path/to/resource?after:page=12&after:storyid=abc123XYZ&user%20id=99
----

Becomes the somewhat weird map:

[source,clojure]
----
{:after:page    "12"
 :after:storyid "abc123XYZ"
 :user id       "99"}
----

IMPORTANT: The odd-looking keywords :after:page and :after:storyid are legal
Clojure keywords, but definitely not an idiomatic usage. The keyword
`:user id` is even more unusual. Clojure keywords can include spaces,
but the Clojure reader cannot parse a keyword literal with spaces in
it.

Query parameters are also merged into the :params map inside the
xref:request-map.adoc[].

== Path Parameters

URL templating is popular with resource-oriented APIs. These use
segments of the URL, in lieu of query parameters, to supply
identifiers.

Pedestal calls these "path parameters". They are parsed from the URL
and bound to the :path-params map in the xref:request-map.adoc[].

Path parameters are always named by a keyword, which is taken from the URL fragment in the route. For example:

|===
| URL | Path param keys
| `/users`                 | none
| `/users/:id`             | :id
| `/users/:id/posts/:post` | :id, :post
|===

In every case, the value of the parameter is a string, taken from the
corresponding segment of the URL.

[#body-parameters]
== Body Parameters

Pedestal can parse form data, JSON, EDN, and Transit data from request
bodies.The parsed information is called "body parameters."

Applications can also provider their own parsers for body parameter
data.

Different routes may use different body parameter formats.

For these reasons, Pedestal does _not_ automatically provide an
interceptor for body parameters.Instead, your application must add an
interceptor to specific routes.

The interceptor is created by the
api:body-params[ns=io.pedestal.http.body-params]
function. Without any arguments, it returns an interceptor that parses
according to the request's `Content-Type` header:

|===
| Content type | Parsed as | Coerce keys to keywords? | Bound to in request | Merged into :params

| application/x-www-form-urlencoded
| HTML form
| Yes
| :form-params{empty}footnote:[:form-params keys are automatically converted to keywords.]
| Yes

| application/json
| JSON
| Yes
| :json-params
| No

| application/transit+json
| Transit JSON encoding
| No
| :transit-params
| No

| application/transit+msgpack
| Transit Msgpack encoding
| No
| :transit-params
| No

| application/edn
| EDN data
| No
| :edn-params
| No

|===

CAUTION: Form parameter keys are not automatically converted to keywords when merged into the :params map.Use the api:keywordize-params[ns=io.pedestal.http.params] interceptor
to convert :params keys to keywords.

If the request has any other content type, the body will not be
altered and the request map will not be changed. That includes a `nil`
content type if the request doesn't include a Content-Type` header.

If you need to customize the way `body-params` handles content types,
or provide options to the built-in parsers, call it with a parser-map
as an argument. You can get a good starting point by calling
api:default-parser-map[ns=io.pedestal.http.body-params].

== File Upload

File upload is a special case of a request body. The request will have
a multipart body with separate encoding for each.

In this case, use an interceptor returned by the
api:multipart-params[ns=io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares]
function. Use the :store option to persist the parts.

== The Method Parameter

Browsers (especially older ones) do not have easy ways to handle
DELETE and PUT requests. Pedestal allows requests to
link:verb-smuggling.adoc[smuggle verbs] through a query parameter.

If the magic query parameter `_method` is present, then its value will
be used as the HTTP verb for this request.

This substitution is handled by the default interceptor
api:method-param[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]. It
occurs before routing, so you can use the correct verbs in your
routes.

Application code can generate links with verb smuggling via the
:method-param option to
api:url-for-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route].
