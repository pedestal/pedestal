= Http-Kit

https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit[Http-Kit] is a high-performance, non-blocking
HTTP server for Clojure; it is small, fast, and has no dependencies.

Http-Kit supports HTTP but not HTTPS.  It does support xref:websockets.adoc[] and
xref:server-sent-events.adoc[].

Http-Kit supports xref:streaming.adoc[], though somewhat differently than Servlet API-based connectors.
