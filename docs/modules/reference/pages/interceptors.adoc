= Interceptors

[TIP]
--
This is the detailed interceptor _reference_; if you are new to Pedestal
you may want to start with the xref:guides:what-is-an-interceptor.adoc[].
--

Interceptors are the basic unit of work in Pedestal. The
core library provides interceptors that are generally useful for
creating HTTP web services. Applications augment those with their own
logic to handle everything specific the application's domain.

An interceptor is a Clojure record with four keys:

- :name
- :enter
- :leave
- :error

The :name key is a keyword, often a namespace-qualified keyword.
The :enter and :leave keys are unary functions.
The :error key is used for error handling.

An interceptor must
provide a :name
footnote:[Omitting the name may result in a deprecation warning; in the future it may cause a runtime exception.]
and at least one of :enter, :leave and :error.

Each function is called with a xref:context-map.adoc[] and must return either a context
map or a {core_async} channel that will deliver a context map; the latter case triggers
xref:guides:async.adoc[asynchronous request processing].

Pedestal calls the :enter function on the way "in" to handling a
request. It calls the :leave function on the way back "out". This is
shown here for a single interceptor:

[seqdiag]
----
seqdiag {
  "Interceptor Chain" -> Interceptor [label=":enter"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- Interceptor
  "Interceptor Chain" -> "Other Interceptors"
  "Interceptor Chain" <- "Other Interceptors"
  "Interceptor Chain" -> Interceptor [label=":leave"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- Interceptor
}
----

Either the :enter or :leave function may be omitted without harm.

Before executing the interceptor chain, the interceptors are added
to a queue, in the specific order of execution.

During the :enter phase, the next interceptor is popped off the queue,
pushed onto the leave stack, and its :enter function, if any, is executed.

Once the handler (or other interceptor) adds a :response to the context,
the chain logic switches to :leave mode: it pops interceptors off
the leave stack and invokes the :leave function, if any.

Because it's the leave _stack_ the :leave functions are invoked
in the opposite order from the :enter functions.

[seqdiag]
----
seqdiag {
  "Interceptor Chain" -> A [label=":enter"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- A
  "Interceptor Chain" -> B [label=":enter"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- B
  "Interceptor Chain" -> C [label=":enter"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- C
  "Interceptor Chain" -> C [label=":leave"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- C
  "Interceptor Chain" -> B [label=":leave"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- B
  "Interceptor Chain" -> A [label=":leave"]
  "Interceptor Chain" <- A
}
----

Both the queue and the stack reside in the context map. Since
interceptors can modify the context map, that means they can change
the plan of execution for the rest of the request! Interceptors are
allowed to enqueue more interceptors to be called, or they can
terminate the request.

This process, of running all the interceptor :enter functions, then running
the interceptor :leave functions, is called _executing the interceptor chain_.

== Context Bindings

Interceptors expect certain keys to be present in the context
map. These _context bindings_ are part of the contract between
Pedestal connector and interceptors.

The most important keys are :request, which holds the xref:request-map.adoc[], and
:response, which (once added to the context) holds the xref:response-map.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
Technically, the interceptor pipeline doesn't know about :request and :response, because
the interceptor pipeline is not specifically purposed with HTTP processing; the Pedestal connector or
xref:servlet-interceptor.adoc[]
adds these details.
====

Further keys are described in the xref:context-map.adoc[] reference.

[#return]
== Interceptor Return Values

Interceptor functions must return the context passed to it, or a modification of that context.
Returning `nil` will cause an internal server error.

An :enter or :leave function may return a context map directly. In
this case, processing continues with the next interceptor.

If the interceptor is expected to take a long time to return a result, it may
instead return a {core_async} channel. Pedestal will yield the request processing thread back
to the network adapter (so that it can process other incoming requests) and
wait for a value to be produced.

Only one value will be consumed from the returned channel, and the value *must* be a context map.

Request processing continues once the channel delivers the context map.

[IMPORTANT]
.*Chaining With Async Interceptors*
--
Any interceptor downstream of an asynchronous interceptor will be executed in the
{core_async} dispatch thread pool.
This can be problematic if any later interceptor or handler performs any blocking I/O, as the thread pool is a fixed
size. Generally speaking, if any interceptor is asynchronous, all following non-trivial interceptors should also be asynchronous.

Trivial interceptors do short computations or make changes to the context map; they do not perform any I/O or other
operations that could block the thread they execute on, such as any file or socket I/O.

If blocking operations are unavoidable, the interceptor should
make use of the core.async `thread` macro.

When an interceptor returns a channel, the request processing thread can be returned to the servlet container.
This may allow another pending request to be processed while the initial request is parked, waiting for
the channel returned by an interceptor to convey the new context map.
--

== IntoInterceptor

An Interceptor is specifically an instance of the
Interceptor record type.

Pedestal is able to convert other values into interceptors
using the
api:IntoInterceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor] protocol.

Pedestal extends that protocol to the following types:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Type | Interpretation

| Map
| The :enter, :leave, :error, and :name keys are used directly.

| Function
| The function is interpreted as a link:#handler[handler].

| List
| The list is evaluated and its result is used as an interceptor. footnote:[This is supported behavior
  related to the xref:table-syntax.adoc[table router syntax], but is no longer commonly used and is deprecated.]
  Support for List is deprecated.

| Cons
| Same as List (and also deprecated)

| Symbol
| The symbol is resolved and its target is converted to an interceptor.

| Var
| The var is de-referenced and its value is converted to an interceptor.

|===

Most of these cases are provided to make routing syntax
easier, or reflect earlier attempts to improve
xref:guides:live-repl.adoc[live reloading at the REPL].

Applications should mainly use the map form as shown in the
earlier examples when defining interceptors for routing
purposes.

[#manipulating]
== Manipulating the interceptor queue

The queue of interceptors remaining to execute is held in the
xref:context-map.adoc[]. This means that an interceptor can
enqueue other interceptors to be executed. In fact, this is exactly how
xref:routing-quick-reference.adoc[routing] works, the router is an interceptor that matches information
from incoming requests to specific routes, then enqueues interceptors for that specific route.

Use
api:enqueue[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain]
to push more interceptors onto the queue.

Use
api:terminate[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.chain]
if processing should not continue - though normally, this is accomplished
by attaching a :response map (the xref:response-map.adoc[]) to the xref:context-map.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
.*Interceptor Records*
--
Interceptors that are explicitly enqueued by the application must
be defined using the
api:interceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor]
function. This function takes a value which extends
the IntoInterceptor protocol, and returns an Interceptor record.

This is not necessary when constructing interceptors used in routing
because interceptor representations are transformed to Interceptor
records during route expansion.  Likewise, interceptors added
to the xref:connector-map.adoc[] (via
api:with-interceptor[ns=io.pedestal.connector]) are converted as they are added.
--

It's worth noting that when an interceptor queues additional interceptors for execution,
they execute after all interceptors already in the queue (not immediately after the interceptor that
modified the queue).  This means you could, for example, put a routing interceptor first
in the queue, then a few interceptors that provide behavior common to all routes, and those
common interceptors will run before any route-specific interceptors.


[#handler]
== Handlers

A handler function is a special case of an interceptor.
Pedestal treats the handler as a function that accepts a xref:request-map.adoc[] parameter,
and returns a xref:response-map.adoc[] result.

A handler does _not_ have access to the full xref:context-map.adoc[execution context],
therefore, it cannot manipulate the interceptor queue.

Because a handler takes one kind of thing (request) and returns a
different kind of thing (response), it can only be used in the last
position of an interceptor stack.

Handlers return a response map; alternately, an asynchronous handler should return a channel that conveys the response map.

Interceptors should always have names
footnote:[In Pedestal 0.8.0 anonymous interceptors are deprecated; in a future release anonymous interceptors
may result in a runtime exeption.].  When a handler function is converted to an Interceptor, Pedestal
will check to see if the function has :name metadata and use that as the Interceptor's name.

Failing that, Pedestal will generate an interceptor name from the function's class name; this does not
always provide ideal results.

[WARNING]
====
When using xref:terse-syntax.adoc[] or xref:verbose-syntax.adoc[] to define routes,
a final interceptor with no specfic name (i.e., generated from a handler function)
will have its name set to match the route name.

In 0.8.0, handler functions will normally always have a name. So, when upgrading from
0.7.x to 0.8.x, you might find that specific interceptors have different names.  This
is unlikely to cause any issues, but in the unlikely event that this behavior
proves to be a problem, it can be
xref:config.adoc#disable-handler-names[disabled].
====

TIP: Provide a keyword :name metadata on your function.

Example:

[source]
----
 (def version-handler
      ^{:name ::get-version} <1>
      (fn [_request] {:status 200 :body "0.3.7"}))


  ; Later, in routes

  ["/api/version" :get version-handler] <2>
----
<1> This is metadata applied to the _function_ itself.  If using `defn`, the metadata would be applied
to the Var, not the function.
<2> Prior to release 0.8.0, this route would be an error,
because there is no explicit route name; now the route name
will be the same as the interceptor's name (whether set explicitly, or derived from the function's class name).

== Error Handling

Pedestal supports defining interceptor-specific error handlers via the
:error key. Refer to the xref:error-handling.adoc[] reference for more details.

== Pedestal Interceptors

The io.pedestal/pedestal.service library includes a large set of interceptors
that are specialized for HTTP request handling.
Many of these interceptors are automatically added to the
interceptor queue via
api:with-default-interceptors[ns=io.pedestal.connector]
or
by the api:default-interceptors[] function,
using information from the xref:service-map.adoc[].

- api:allow-origin[ns=io.pedestal.http.cors]
- api:anti-forgery[ns=io.pedestal.http.csrf]
- api:body-params[ns=io.pedestal.http.body-params]
- api:dev-allow-origin[ns=io.pedestal.http.cors]
- api:method-param[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
- api:negotiate-content[ns=io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation]
- api:path-params-decoder[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
- api:query-params[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
- several from api:*[ns=io.pedestal.http.ring-middlewares] (see also
  xref:ring.adoc[])

Routing-related interceptors are provided by the io.pedestal/pedestal.route library:

- api:path-params-decoder[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
- api:query-params[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]
- api:router[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]

But these are usually provided automatically, such as via
api:with-routes[ns=io.pedestal.connector].
