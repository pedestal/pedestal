= Response Bodies

This reference describes how the xref:servlet-interceptor.adoc[] handles
response bodies of various types. Much of this behavior depends on the
protocols `WritableBody` and `WritableBodyAsync`. See
xref:important-protocols.adoc[] for details about those.

The exact handling of the response body depends on the Java or Clojure
type of the value in the :body key of the xref:response-map.adoc[].

| byte array | application/octet-stream | direct byte copy | no
| string     | text/plain               | bytes according to platform's default character encoding | no

| File               | application/octet-stream | bytes of the file copied to the output stream | no
| InputStream        | application/octet-stream | bytes of the input stream copied to the output stream | no
| ReadableByteChannel (NIO) | application/octet-stream | bytes of the channel copied to the output stream | yes
| ByteBuffer (NIO) | application/octet-stream | bytes of the buffer copied to the output stream | yes
| {core_async} channel | nil | see below | yes

[#nio-channel]
== nio Channel
When the response body is a ByteBuffer or an NIO Channel, then the
Pedestal connector _may_ convert the response to
https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/servlets012.htm[asynchronous processing]
(if this is supported by the network connector).

This returns the thread to the container's request processing thread pool,
and the container will (efficiently) stream the contents of the buffer or channel to the client.

== Core Async Channel

When a {core_async} channel delivers a message, that message is written
to the stream, using any of the synchronous dispatches above. The
message from the channel must not be another channel, it must be a value that
can be immediately acted upon.

[WARNING]
====
At this time, the xref:http-kit.adoc[] support does not handle the following types conveyed in the channel:

* Function
* Collections
* ReadableByteChannel

However, the support is sufficient for xref:server-sent-events.adoc[].

====


== Function

When the body is, in fact, a function, then Pedestal will invoke the function with a
java.lang.OutputStream; the function's responsibility is to write the actual response to that stream.
