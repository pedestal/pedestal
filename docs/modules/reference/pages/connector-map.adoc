= Connector Map
:reftext: connector map
:navtitle: Connector Map
:default_api_ns: io.pedestal.connector

Pedestal provides functions to create a xref:connector.adoc[].

The service map contains general information that any Pedestal connector will need to create a network connector.
This is supplemented by a connector-specific configuration map.

TIP: Pedestal connectors were added in 0.8.0 as a replacement for the service map and the
api:*[ns=io.pedestal.http] namespace.

== Connector Map Keys

An initial connector map can be created by api:default-connector-map[].

[cols="s,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key |  Type | Description

| :port | Number | Port for the network connector to receive connections on
| :host | String | Hostname to listen on, defaults to "localhost"
| :router | Keyword or fn | Routing constructor to use, default is xref:sawtooth-router.adoc[:sawtooth]
| :interceptors | Vector | Interceptor to used when processing requests.
| :initial-context | Map | Initial context that will be used when executing the interceptor chain
| :join? | Boolean | If true (the default is false) then the current thread will block when the connector is started.
|===

The created Pedestal connector will often prefix the supplied interceptors with ones specific to the connector.

TIP: Supplying an :initial-context is a way to provide useful data, functions, or components to all interceptors.

== Default interceptors

The api:with-default-interceptors[] function is used to add interceptors to the service map for
common functionality.  It is passed the connector map and an additional configuration map and will
add interceptors for the following functionality:

* Request tracing
* Request logging
* Allowed origins
* Session support
* Cross site request forgery detection
* Default content type for responses
* Parsing of query parameters
* Secure headers (adds a few headers to improve security)

[WARNING]
====
`with-default-interceptors` is useful, but limited. It doesn't let you fully configure many of the interceptors
it adds, and it may add interceptors you do not need.
It is intended as _scaffolding_: useful only at the outset of a new project, but should be
removed and replaced with application specific setup once development is fully underway.
====

== Routing

The api:with-routes[] macro is used to set the routes for your service.
It is a macro because it sets up a REPL-friendly
workflow (when in xref:dev-mode.adoc[development mode]) --- in development mode,
code changes will be reflected immediately, without restarting the application.

== Creating the Pedestal connector

The connector map is passed to a Pedestal connector factory function, along with a map of configuration
specific to the specific factor, and returns a
api:PedestalConnector[ns=io.pedestal.service.protocols] object, which can be started with api:start![].

Factory functions:

- api:create-connector[ns=io.pedestal.http.jetty] (Jetty)
- api:create-connector[ns=io.pedestal.http.http-kit] (Http-Kit)

== Development Mode

Functions in the
api:*[ns=io.pedestal.connector.dev] namespace provide additional support that may be used
when developing and testing locally, but should not be used in production.

The api:optionally-with-dev-mode-interceptors[] function adds useful development-time interceptors,
but only if xref:dev-mode.adoc[] is enabled.
