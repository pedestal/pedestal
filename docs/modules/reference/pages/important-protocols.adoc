= Important Protocols

The major parts of Pedestal are isolated via Clojure protocols. The
protocols are for internal structure and external extension. This
reference identifies the most important protocols in Pedestal's
structure and how you might use them in an application.

== Interceptor Protocols

=== api:IntoInterceptor[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor]

IntoInterceptor allows pretty much anything to become an interceptor
when needed.

Routers use this when building routes: anything that satisfies
IntoInterceptor is legal to use in the interceptor vector of a
route.

This protocol also comes into play when
xref:interceptors.adoc#manipulating[appending new interceptors to the queue].

Pedestal extends IntoInterceptor onto a variety of Clojure and Java
types. See the xref:interceptors.adoc[interceptors reference] for details of their behaviors.

== Routing Protocols

=== api:ExpandableRoutes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route]

ExpandableRoutes can convert all kinds of data structures representing a set of routes into a single
canonical format that can be used to construct a routing function. This expansion occurs inside the
api:expand-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] function.

Pedestal provides implementations of ExpandableRoutes for several types:

|===
| Type                           | Interpretation
| clojure.lang.APersistentVector | xref:terse-syntax.adoc[]
| clojure.lang.APersistentMap    | xref:verbose-syntax.adoc[]
| clojure.lang.APersistentSet    | xref:table-syntax.adoc[]
|===

Likewise, each of the underlying routing specification functions
(such as api:table-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route.definition.table]) returns
an ExpandableRoutes.

Since the call to expand-routes comes from application code, it
would be rare for an application to need to extend ExpandableRoutes.

The result of expand-routes is a wrapper around a
xref:routing-quick-reference.adoc#routing-table[seq of maps]
that will be passed to the routing contructor function.

== Service Protocols

=== api:PedestalConnector[ns=io.pedestal.service.protocols]

A connector encapsulates a network adapter, such as xref:jetty.adoc[]; a connector
is responsible for configuring, starting, and stopping the network adapter. In addition,
a connector can be used for testing, even without starting the network adapter.

== Servlet Protocols

These are specific to using Pedestal with a network connector that implements
the Jakarta Servlet API, such as xref:jetty.adoc[].

=== api:WritableBody[ns=io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor]

This protocol applies to anything that can be in the :body key of a
xref:response-map.adoc[].
The two functions in the protocol tell Pedestal what content type the body implies, and how to serialize
the body to an output stream.

Pedestal extends this protocol to several Java and Clojure types to produce the behavior detailed in xref:response-bodies.adoc[].

Applications should not assume any output stream type more specific
than java.io.OutputStream.

=== api:WritableBodyAsync[ns=io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor]

This protocol is a more specific version of WritableBody. If the
value in the :body key of a xref:response-map.adoc[]
satisfies WritableBodyAsync, then Pedestal treats it as a streaming
result. See xref:streaming.adoc[] for full details.

It would be rare for an application to extend this protocol. Most of
the time, an application would be better off providing an NIO channel
or a {core_async} channel in the response body.
