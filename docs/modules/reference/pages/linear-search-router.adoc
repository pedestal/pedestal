= Linear Search Router

== Motivation

Provides the user with the most control over routing outside of
implementing a custom router.

== Why use it?

You require precise control over routing and the routing performance
tradeoff is acceptable to your service.

== How to use it?

Set the key :router in the xref:connector-map.adoc[] to the
value :linear-search.

== Caveats

This implementation routes requests in linear time, so it's the simplest and slowest of Pedestal's router implementations.

== Additional Notes

Pedestal's first router implementation. 

Query and path constraints are used in routing decisions unlike the
xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[] or xref:map-tree-router.adoc[].  That is, if a route
is considered (based on path, method, and so forth) but the path or query parameters
violate the constraints defined in the route, then the search will continue.
For the other routers, a route is matched and then either used, or (if constraints
do not match) the entire request is treated as unrouted.
