= Development Mode

Pedestal can operate in two different modes: production, and local development.

Local development mode changes the behavior of a handful of macros and functions to support
xref:guides:live-repl.adoc[live development at the REPL].

Development mode is enabled via a
xref:config.adoc#dev-mode[configuration value].

The var api:dev-mode?[ns=io.pedestal.environment] stores the boolean result derived from reading the system property;
there is no mechanism for turning development mode on or off during execution.

[CAUTION]
====
Certain macros, such as
api:with-routes[ns=io.pedestal.connector],
change their behavior when in development mode.  If you are AOT compling
your application prior to deployment, you must ensure that development mode is *off*
when compiling, or you may get development mode behavior (and decreased performance)
in your deployed production application.
