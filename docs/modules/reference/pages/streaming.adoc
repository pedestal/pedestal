= Streaming Responses

In some cases, you may want to stream large responses back to clients.
Streaming uses memory efficiently and can allow you to return a
response larger than the service's memory. It also allows a client to
start consuming data as quickly as possible.

|===

Async responses use non-blocking I/O. Not all containers support async
responses.

== Using a Function as the Response

When the body is a function, the servlet-interceptor calls that
function with a single argument: a `jakarta.servlet.ServletOutputStream`.

The response status code and headers will already be written to the
stream before calling the function.

The function should close the stream when it is done.

The function's return value is ignored.

The function may run as long as it needs. This will occupy a thread,
so consider using a {core_async} `go` or `thread` block.

== Using a Collection as the Response

A collection will be rendered into text via `clojure.core/pr`. This
emits a valid EDN encoding of the data.

The entire collection will be emitted. This means lazy sequences will
be fully realized.

Rendering collections is subject to `\*print-length*`, `\*print-level*`,
and all other variables that affect `clojure.core/pr`.

== Using a {core_async} Channel as the Response

When the response body is a channel, every message read from the
channel will be sent to the client as it is produced.

If the client disconnects, the channel will be closed.

== Uses

Here are some examples of potentially large values that you might want
to stream back to clients:

- the contents of a lazy sequence
- a file or resource stored on disk
- a byte stream retrieved from some service, e.g., an image on S3
