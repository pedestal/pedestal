= Map Tree Router

== Motivation

Many Pedestal-based services do not leverage every routing
feature. The Map Tree router is optimized for the _static routes_ use
case.

== Why use it?

Routes requests in constant time (path matching is done by map
lookup).

== How to use it?

Set the key :router in the xref:connector-map.adoc[] to the
value :map-tree.

== Caveats

If the routes provided have any path parameters or wildcards, the
xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[] will be used instead.

== Additional Notes

Like the xref:prefix-tree-router.adoc[], query and path
constraints are not used in routing decisions. They are only used to
invalidate a route match.
