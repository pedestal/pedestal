:navtitle: Response Map

The response map is attached to the xref:context-map.adoc[] by any
xref:interceptors.adoc[interceptor] in the interceptor chain. The response map describes the outgoing
HTTP response. If no response map is attached to the context by the time
processing is done, then Pedestal generates a 404 response.

When an interceptor attaches a response map (or a handler function returns a response map), the map is validated:

- Must be a map
- Must contain a positive integer value for the :status

If the response fails the above validations, an exception is thrown. footnote:[Prior to Pedestal 0.7,
an invalid :response would be ignored instead, and the https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/830[execution would continue], subverting the developer's expectations.]

The function api:respond-with[] is the easiest way to add a response map to the interceptor context.

|===
| Key | Always Present? | Type | Description
| :status
| Y
| integer
| The HTTP status code

| :headers
| N
| map of String -> String
| Response headers sent to the client. Header names are case-sensitive.

| :body
| N
| String, ISeq, File, InputStream, etc.
| The body of the response sent to the client; see xref:response-bodies.adoc[] for more details.
|===


WARNING: Application code that returns a header should use the proper case version of the header, for example,
`Content-Type` (not `content-type`); although incoming xref:request-map.adoc[request headers] are converted
to lower case, outgoing response headers are left as-is, and some standard interceptors expects
certain headers to be present with the correct name (such as `Content-Type`).
