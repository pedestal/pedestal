= Error Handling
:default_api_ns: io.pedestal.interceptor.chain

Pedestal must do something useful when an interceptor throws an
exception. It would not be useful to bubble up the runtime call stack,
because that call stack only includes the Pedestal machinery
itself. Interceptors are data structures that conceptually represent
frames on a call stack, but they are not present in the usual
nested fashion on the Java call stack.

Remember that request processing may be asynchronous, in which case
the call stack doesn't even represent the flow of control to the point
where the exception occurred.

Instead, Pedestal works backwards, looking for an interceptor to handle
the exception. All exceptions thrown from an
interceptor are captured; Pedestal wraps such exceptions in an `ExceptionInfo` instance
which is then bound to the :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/error key
in the xref:context-map.adoc[context map].

As long as there is an error attached to that key, Pedestal will not
invoke the usual :enter and :leave functions. Instead, it looks
for the next interceptor in the stack that has an :error function
attached to it.

This error handling will proceed the same, regardless of whether
interceptors in the chain returned a xref:context-map.adoc[context map] or
async channel. (See
xref:interceptors.adoc#return[Interceptor Return Values] for details on async return.)
As a result, Pedestal unifies
error handling for synchronous interceptors and asynchronous
interceptors.

You can supply your own error handling interceptor anywhere in the interceptor queue.

== Error Function

Pedestal will call the function bound to the :error key of an interceptor with two arguments:

- The xref:context-map.adoc[context map]
- An `ExceptionInfo` instance

Pedestal wraps *all* exceptions in ex-info. The following keys are
defined in its exception data map:

|===
| Key | Type | Description

| :execution-id
| _opaque_ footnote:[No guarantees are made on what the execution id's type or structure is.]
| Unique value that identifies one "run" through the interceptors.

| :stage
| Keyword
| Either :enter or :leave depending on which direction the
  execution was going.

| :interceptor
| Keyword
| The :name from the interceptor that threw the exception

| :exception-type
| Keyword
| Keywordized form of the exception's Java class name

|===

The exception originally caught is provided as the clj:ex-cause[] of the provided exception.

The context map does _not_ contain the
:io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/error key. The :error function can do
one of the following things:

1. Return the context map. This is "catching" the error. Because the
context map has no error bound to it, Pedestal will exit error
handling and execute any remaining :leave handlers.
2. Return the context map with the exception re-attached (using
  api:with-error[]).  This indicates that the
handler doesn't recognize that exception and declines to handle
it. Pedestal will continue looking for a handler.
3. Throw a new exception. This indicates that the interceptor _intended_
to handle the error, but something went wrong. Pedestal
will start looking for a error handler for this new exception.

In that last case, Pedestal keeps track of the exceptions that were
overridden. These are in a seq bound to
:io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/suppressed in the context map.

The interceptor may also rethrow the error passed to it rather than re-attach
the error, but this is discouraged.

Most commonly, the interceptor will return the context map with a :response
map; this will trigger normal response processing by invoking any remaining interceptors' :leave functions.

== Error Dispatch Interceptor

As a convenience, Pedestal offers a macro to build error-handling
interceptors that use pattern-matching to dispatch.

api:error-dispatch[ns=io.pedestal.interceptor.error]
builds interceptors that use
link:https://github.com/clojure/core.match[core.match] to select a clause.

[NOTE]
====
This function is provided in the io.pedestal/pedestal.error library; to use
`error-dispatch`, you must explicitly include the library in your project.
====

Error dispatch uses
core.match to match the clj:ex-data[] of the exception; this allows you
to handle a variety of different scenarios very concisely.  core.match works
top-to-bottom, so you order your most specific cases first, and your
more general cases later.

Each match clauses specifies certain keys from the above list, and corresponding
values to match against; the first match term that satisified all the conditions
is executed, which determines the behavior when a matching error occurs.

Here is an example from the test suite:

[source,clojure]
----
(def service-error-handler ;; <1>
  (error-dispatch [context ex]
    ;; <2>
    [{:exception-type :java.lang.ArithmeticException :interceptor ::another-bad-one}]
    (assoc context :response {:status 400 :body "Another bad one"})

    ;; <3>
    [{:exception-type :java.lang.ArithmeticException}]
    (assoc context :response {:status 400 :body "A bad one"})

    ;; <4>
    :else
    (assoc context :io.pedestal.interceptor.chain/error ex)))

...

(def routes
  (route/expand-routes
    #{["/v1/api" :any  [service-error-handler ,,,]]})) ;; <5>
----
<1> This macro returns code that evaluates to an interceptor with a :leave callback. Binding the interceptor to a var is the normal case.
<2> This is a pattern match that looks for an `ArithmeticException`, but only thrown by a particular interceptor. If the pattern matches, this expression gets evaluated. The error is handled and a response attached.
<3> Another pattern match expression, matching any `ArithmeticException` s that weren't matched before. We return a different response body in these cases.
<4> :else always matches because it is a truthy value. Reattaching the error tells Pedestal to keep looking for a handler.
<5> We use the resulting interceptor like any other.

== Logging Uncaught Exceptions

For HTTP, the xref:servlet-interceptor.adoc[] provides the "last
ditch" error handlers that log the error and return an _error_ response. In
development mode, they emit a formatted stack trace as the response body; you will see
the error logged from the :io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor/stylobate
footnote:[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stylobate[Stylobate] is the term for a supporter of columns in
classic Greek and Roman architecture; here the interceptor is providing support to the rest of Pedestal.]
interceptor.

WARNING: The error logged by the "last ditch" error handler includes the context
map. This is often quite large and may contain data you do not wish to log.

While having defaults is nice, it is highly recommended that services implement
their own error handling/logging. This gives you full control over how errors
are processed.

Some exceptions should not be logged; by default, Pedestal will identify
an exception that indicates a broken pipe to the client when sending the response; such errors will not be
logged but will be quietly ignored.

An exception analyzer function is passed the xref:context-map.adoc[] and the unhandled exception;
it may return nil to prevent the exception from being logged, or return the exception itself,
or an alternate exception, to have that be the exception that is logged.

When not specified, the api:default-exception-analyzer[ns=io.pedestal.http.impl.servlet-interceptor] function is used;
this is where the logic to check for a broken pipe exception lives.
