= Architecture Overview

== Motivation

We created Pedestal as a web framework. At the base, every web
framework must solve certain common problems:

1. Interpret incoming requests
2. Dispatch to application code
3. Produce a well-formed response

There is an unstated requirement that these all work in a variety of
deployment environments:

- Local development of a workspace
- Packaged into a Jar file
- An exploded version of a packaged Jar file
- Packaged into a Docker container

Further, different teams prefer a variety of different request handling frameworks:

- Tomcat
- Jetty
- Undertow
- Netty
- Vert.x
- etc.

One more dimension of complexity arises from the relevant styles of
application we want to support:

- Traditional server-rendered pages
- An API supporting a SPA (Single Page Application)
- Streaming events
- Bidirectional WebSockets
- A mix of all of the above

Importantly, supporting streaming events and WebSockets are explicitly asynchronous.

Finally, we wish to ensure that, whatever selections are made above,
the end result is operationally sound:

- Secure
- Performant
- Observable (capable of producing metrics and tracing information)

== High Level Sequence

seqdiag {
  "HTTP Client" -> "Network connector" [label = "HTTP Request"]
  "Network connector" -> "Pedestal connector"
  "Pedestal connector" -> "Interceptor chain" [label="Executes"]
  "Interceptor chain" -> "Connector\ninterceptors"
  "Interceptor chain" <- "Connector\ninterceptors"

  "Interceptor chain" <- "Application\ninterceptors"
  "Pedestal connector" <- "Interceptor chain"
  "Network connector" <- "Pedestal connector"
  "HTTP Client" <- "Network connector" [label = "HTTP Response"]
}
----

Requests flow in from clients, through the network connector (such as xref:jetty.adoc[]), which in turn,
delegates to a Pedestal connector to handle the bulk of the request.  This processing takes the form of
a series of xref:#interceptor[interceptors], in a specific order, each focused on one small part of the processing of the request.
The interceptor chain manages the execution of the interceptors.

The Pedestal connector provides interceptors that deal with the mechanics of interfacing with
the chosen Network connector; the application provides additional interceptors for application-specific behaviors.

== Interceptors

Pedestal is far from the first web framework for Clojure, and attempts to expand on ideas
piloted elsewhere.
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring[Ring] is likely the most popular and influential.
In Ring, each _route_ (a combination of an HTTP method and a path pattern) is mapped to a handler:
the handler is just a simple function which accepts a request map as its input, and
returns a response map.

Because a server is more than a single route, and because many routes will share a lot of behavior such as logging,
authentication, response rendering, and parameter parsing, each individual Ring route is wrapped in _middleware_,
a function that wraps an existing handler and returns a new handler.
Middleware can inspect and modify the incoming request map or the outgoing response map.

For example, perhaps your Ring application needs to respond specially to HEAD requests;

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$org/example/middleware.clj[]
----
<1> This is the returned handler, wrapping around the original handler
<2> Ring specifies at set of keys for the request map; Pedestal follows the same rules
<3> Ring specifies another set of keys for the response map
<4> Here's where we delegate down to the next handler

This is good, functional design, but is limited in at least one way: it's all on the stack of a single request processing thread.
Given how great Clojure is at multithreaded programming, that can be a limitation.
Several of the central features of Pedestal (such as streaming events and web socket connections) are at odds with this:
in these cases a long-running server-side process only _occasionally_ needs a request processing thread to send an event,
or web socket message, to the client.

So, in Pedestal we want something as easily reused and composable as Ring middleware functions, without
the limitations of the stack-of-function-calls invocation model.
That's interceptors.

An interceptor is a bundle of up-to three functions, named :enter, :leave, and :error.

:enter corresponds to the logic before delegating to the next interceptor; the request can be inspected or modified.
Likewise, :leave corresponds to logic that occurs _after_ a response map has been created.
The :error function is used when an interceptor throws an exception; it's the interceptor version of a `(try ... catch ...)`.

Now, there's a bit more going on.  First, these :enter and :leave functions are passed a _context_ map which
contains a :request key.
Any interceptor can modify the context map: some may modify the :request map inside the context, others may
attach a :response map to the context.

Inside the context is a queue of interceptors.
Pedestal works its way through the queue, calling :enter functions, until some interceptor attaches a
:response map to the context;
then it works its way backwards, calling :leave functions.

In practice, an interceptor looks like a normal Clojure map with keys :enter, :leave, or :error (usually just :enter and/or :leave).
So, unlike a deeply wrapped function, a chain of interceptors is a data structure that can be inspected by a developer, or manipulated in code.

Importantly, any interceptor can _add_ new interceptors to the queue (because the interceptor queue itself is stored
in the context, alongside the :request map).  Because of this,
xref:routing-quick-reference.adoc[routing] boils down to an interceptor
that peeks at the request and makes decisions about what additional interceptors to add to the queue.

Pedestal includes general purpose interceptors for all sorts of typical HTTP request functionality:

- Content negotiation
- Request body parsing
- Routing
- Parsing query parameters
- Assigning content type to the response

Application logic is also implemented as interceptors, though there's some simple helpers that allow you to write
these as Ring-style handlers, if you like.

But Pedestal has one more big trick up its sleeve: any interceptor may, instead of returning a context map,
instead return a {core_async} channel that conveys the context map at some point
in the future; this is what allows for asynchronous request processing.

Further details are in the xref:interceptors.adoc[interceptors reference].

== Servlet vs. HTTP

Up through Pedestal 0.7, all HTTP support was grounded in some
version of the {servlet-api}, typically via the xref:jetty.adoc[] library.

With Pedestal 0.8, Pedestal now supports libraries, such as
xref:http-kit.adoc[], that provide HTTP support without implementing
the Servlet API. Such libraries are called "Network Connectors".

=== Pedestal Connectors

The newer approach, starting in Pedestal 0.8, is based on combining a
xref:connector-map.adoc[]
with a Network connector; a function specific to each
Network connector converts the connector map to a
Pedestal connector.

Support for this is primarily in the api:*[ns=io.pedestal.connector] namespace.
