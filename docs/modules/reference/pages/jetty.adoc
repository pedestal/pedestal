Jetty supports xref:streaming.adoc[].

== Container Options

The provided container options are generally sufficient for most applications which use HTTP or HTTPs; some options
are callback functions to provide greater custom control over the Jetty objects.

The following table lists the container options supported by Jetty.

[cols="m,d,d", options="header", grid="rows"]
|===
| Key | Value type | Description

| :daemon?
| Boolean
| Use daemon threads. Defaults to `false`.

| :context-path

| Context path for the application; must start with a `/`.  Defaults to `/`.

| :max-threads
| Integer
| The maximum number of threads to use. Defaults to `50`.

| :max-streams
| Integer
| The maximum number of concurrent streams for an HTTP2 or HTTP2C connector. Defaults to `128`.


| :reuse-addr?
| Boolean
| Reuse the socket address. Defaults to `true`.

| :thread-pool

| Override the Jetty thread pool (ignores max-threads)

| :configurator
| Function
| A function called with the link:{apiroot}/org/eclipse/jetty/server/Server.html[Server]
instance. Expected to return the Server instance. Use when advanced customization is required.

| :context-configurator
| Function
| A function called with the link:{apiroot}/org/eclipse/jetty/ee10/servlet/ServletContextHandler.html[ServletContextHandler] instance. Use when advanced customization is required.

| :ssl?

| :h2?
| Boolean
| HTTP/2 TLS support. When `true`, :ssl-port must also be specified.

| :connection-factory-fns
| Vector of Functions
| A vector of functions that each take the options map and
an link:{HttpConfiguration} instance and return a

the SSL connection.

| :ssl-context-factory
| An link:{apiroot}/org/eclipse/jetty/util/ssl/SslContextFactory.html[SslContextFactory] instance.
| The `SSLContextFactory` instance to use when creating the server. If
specified, :key-password, :keystore, :truststore,
:trust-password, :security-provider, :client-auth are ignored.

| :keystore
| String _or_ `java.security.Keystore`
| Used for TLS. Path to keystore file _or_ a `java.security.Keystore` instance. Not used if :ssl-context-factory is set.

| :key-password
| String
| Used for TLS. Keystore password. Not used if :ssl-context-factory is set.

| :truststore
| String _or_ `java.security.Keystore`
| Used for TLS. Path to keystore file _or_ a `java.security.Keystore` instance. Not used if :ssl-context-factory is set.

| :trust-password
| String
| Used for TLS. Trust store password. Not used if :ssl-context-factory is set.

| :client-auth
| String
| SSL client certificate authenticate, may be set to :need,

|===

== Default HttpConfiguration

The default link:{HttpConfiguration} is:

* `SendDateHeader` is set to `true`
* `SendXPoweredBy` is set to `false`
* `SendServerVersion` is set to `false`
* An instance of `org.eclipse.jetty.server.SecureRequestCustomizer` is
added via `addCustomizer`
* When :ssl?, :ssl-port or `h2?` is provided,
`securePort` is set to the value of :ssl-port and `secureScheme`
is set to `"https"`.
