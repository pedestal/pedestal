= Contributing to Pedestal

== Hacking on Pedestal

=== Checkout Instructions

All the code is in one repository, with subprojects for the different
modules. Just clone https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal and you are
good to go.


=== First Time

It's well known that transitive dependencies are the devil, and Pedestal has many internal
and external dependencies.

The first time you work on Pedestal, especially a version that has never yet been uploaded to Clojars, you must perform an initialization step; if you fail to do so, you may see tests fails with a
ClassNotFoundException exception, related to io.pedestal.servlet.ClojureVarServlet.

From the root directory, execute:

    clj -T:build install

From the `servlet` directory, execute:

    clj -T:build compile-java :aliases '[:local :servlet-api]'

This will compile a few Java classes, including ClojureVarServlet.

=== Testing Pedestal Itself

If you're working on Pedestal itself, you can test everything with a single command.

From the `tests` directory, execute `clj -X:test`.

== Contributing to Pedestal

Thanks for your interest in helping out with Pedestal! Let this document
serve as your guide. (This is a copy of
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING.md]
in the main https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/[Pedestal repo]. If
you ever see a discrepancy, it's probably because this document is out
of date relative to that one.)

=== Looking for work?

If you're looking for a task to work on, check out the
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues?labels=primed[primed label] in our issues.

Less defined tasks will be marked with the
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues?labels=discuss[discuss
label]. Jump in here if you want to be a part of something big.

=== New Features

Pedestal is the thinking person's framework, so every contribution starts with
some *deep* thought. Finished?

Alright, your next step is to start a discussion.

Create an https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/new[issue] to start
a conversation. Tell us what you're trying to accomplish and how you think you
might do it. If all is well, we'll probably give you the thumbs up to
start developing.

=== Bugs

Of course, if you run into any straight-up bugs or weirdness feel free to skip
the thinking (or at least too much of it) and immediately submit an
https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/new[issue].

We have an issue template in place that will ask you some details
about the platform you are running and how to reproduce the bug. (If
you can reproduce it reliably. If not, go ahead and file the issue
anyway so we can start looking at it.)

Some of the usual stuff we'll want to know:

* What happened?
** "I manifested a being from the outer dimensions."
* What did you expect to happen?
** "Hello, world."
* How can you reproduce it?
** "I created a new Pedestal service with the template, then installed some code that Bob Howard gave me."
* What operating system and version are you using?
** e.g. "OS X 10.8"
* What version of Clojure, Java, and Leiningen or Boot are you using?
** e.g. "Leiningen 2.5.2 on Java 1.8.0_u40 Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM"
* What Pedestal version are you using?
** e.g. "0.5.0"
** or, for a SNAPSHOT: "0.5.1-SNAPSHOT at d0cf2b4"

Even better, include a link to a gist or repository where we can jump straight
to the problem.

=== Tests

We love well-tested code. We won't accept pull requests unless they're
either well tested or sufficiently trivial (such as simple docstring
changes). All of our code is tested via GitHub actions, and any pull
requests you submit will be too.

=== Workflow

Pedestal is broken up into several pieces. You'll usually be working
on just one of these pieces at a time, but you will want to test
everything. Here is the workflow we recommend:

1. Fork the https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal[repo] and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch for your feature/bugfix.
3. Make your changes and add tests.
4. Run `clj -X:test` from the `tests` directory.
5. Run `clj -T:build lint` from the root directory.
6. Commit, push, and submit a pull request.

== Contributor's Agreement

When it comes to code contributions there is one more thing we need from
you: a signed contributor's agreement.

We know that a contributor's agreement can be a pain, but we want everyone
to be able to use Pedestal, including developers working on projects for very
large companies. Many of these big organizations care *a lot* about the provenance of
the code they use -- that is they need to know where the code came from and who owns it.
The contributor's agreement simply puts down in writing what we think is the
standard open source arrangement: Mostly it says that you are donating code that
you wrote to the project. By submitting a signed contributor's agreement,
you are helping to ensure that your work will be available to the largest possible audience.

It is an extra step, but there really is not much to executing the Pedestal contributor's agreement:
You just need to complete the following online agreement to assign copyright to Nubank.
