= Hello World
:experimental:

== Welcome

We're glad you've decided to give Pedestal a try. We think it's pretty
powerful. Before we get into the heavy lifting though, we should start
with some basics.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Create a Pedestal project from scratch
- Define a handler and a route for that handler
- Return plain text in your response from that handler
- Setup and run an HTTP server around the route

== Guide Assumptions

This guide is for beginners who are new to Pedestal. It doesn't assume
that you have any prior experience with Pedestal, Clojure, or any
other Clojure-based web framework. You should be somewhat familiar with the
basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to xref:your-first-api.adoc[] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

We will be using the Clojure CLI tools to manage dependencies and download
libraries. Refer to the Clojure
link:https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Getting Started] page
for installation instructions and details.

== Getting Help If You're Stuck

include::partial$getting-help.adoc[]

This guide shows fragments of code as we add them. Sometimes it helps
to see the whole thing at once, so you can always check out
<<whole-shebang>> at the end of this guide.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we're going to take a series of small steps. We'll see
all the code to build a Pedestal service starting with an empty
directory.

The first time through, we will just do everything "by hand". This is
a little more work in typing (or copy-and-pasting) but it will let you
see how the pieces connect in the simplest possible use case.

== Before We Begin

Pedestal services are written in Clojure code, which you then run on a
Java Virtual Machine. You will need to have a Java Runtime Environment
installed on your computer. Let's make sure you're up to date. Fire up
a terminal and put in this command:

----
$ java -version
----

You should see some output something like this:

----
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.19" 2023-04-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-11.0.19.7.1 (build 11.0.19+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-11.0.19.7.1 (build 11.0.19+7-LTS, mixed mode)
----

If you get an error, such as
"Command not found" or some variation of that, you probably need to
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/downloads/index.html#java[install
Java].

The second thing is to make sure that the Java version is at least
{base-java-version}.

OK, so now that you are ready to run a Java application, let's move on
to the Pedestal part.

== Starting From Scratch

We're going to start this project with an empty directory. In
practice, most of the time you'll generate a project from a
xref:embedded-template.adoc[template]. But for now, it's more important to see what the individual pieces are
and how they fit together.

I'm going to call my project 'hello-world'. Feel free to call yours
something different, but it's up to you to do the mental translation
in the rest of this guide.

----
$ mkdir hello-world
$ cd hello-world
----

A quick note on naming style. Clojure itself uses "kebab case" for its
names. That's lowercase words, separated with hyphens. When you have a
long name, it looks like the letters have been skewered. Hence, kebab
case. Since Clojure's own libraries use this style, most applications
and libraries do too.

We need a place to keep our code. By convention, that's in a `src`
(short for "source") directory:

----
$ mkdir src
----

== A Place to Put Things

Now we're going to create a file under `src` to hold our code. Call it
`src/hello.clj`. It's going to start with a _namespace declaration_. This
tell Clojure what namespace to put the code into. If you're familiar with Java,
you can think of a namespace as similar to a Java package name.

[source, clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> This namespace is called 'hello'. This almost always matches the filename.
<2> We need to use the `io.pedestal.connector` namespace, abbreviated as `conn`.
<3> We need to use the `io.pedestal.http.http-kit` namespace, abbreviated as `hk`.

The clj:ns[] form establishes a name for your namespace; this is the name
that other namespaces can use to reference the functions and constants
provided by the `hello` namespace.

The :require clause is how the `hello` namespace identifies other namespaces
it uses; requiring a namespace loads its source and, optionally, creates an _alias_ for the namespace.

This is very similar to using `import` in Java or `require` in
Ruby. It just makes some names from other namespaces available to us
in this namespace.

Clojure's main namespace, `clojure.core`, is special; its contents are mixed into every namespace automatically.

If you haven't written any Clojure before, this syntax might look a
little strange. The first thing that jumps out at people is the
parentheses. Why is there an open paren _before_ the `ns`? In Clojure,
every expression is enclosed in its very own set of parentheses. There
are no semicolons to end the line or curly braces to close an `if`
expression. To find the end of any expression, you just find the
matching close paren.

The first thing in an expression is the function or macro
footnote:[There's some important distinctions between a Clojure function
and a Clojure macro and _you don't have to think about that one bit_ when
you are first getting started with Clojure.]
to call.
In this case `ns` is a macro that is built in to Clojure. It sets up a
namespace and makes the stuff we :require available.

Each namespace is loaded from a Clojure source file.  A Clojure
namespace provides _symbols_ and those symbols are the names of functions, macros, or constants.

Where the :require says :as `something` it means we're making an
_alias_ inside our namespace (the `hello` namespace).

Because `hello` has required the `io.pedestal.connector` namespace, it can make use of functions in that namespace, such as `io.pedestal.connector/with-default-interceptors`.  This is the truest form, where every symbol a namespace has a full name that includes the namespace.

That's cumbersome to type again and again, which is why we set up the alias; `conn/with-default-interceptors` is exactly the same, but more concise and more readable.

Also, don't worry about the indentation ... Clojure
ignores whitespace outside quoted strings entirely. Many common
editors support Clojure with some form of plugin, and these can help
you keep your code formatting clean and orderly (and much more besides).

So what exactly are the  `io.pedestal.connector` and
`io.pedestal.http.http-kit` namespaces?

The
api:*[ns=io.pedestal.connector]
namespace has functions that are used to describe a Pedestal connector.

A Pedestal connector exists to connect the network world of HTTP requests and responses
to the Pedestal world of maps and functions.
The `io.pedestal.connector` namespace has functions and macros to describe the connector and ultimately
start it listening to a TCP/IP port for HTTP requests.

Pedestal has connectors for several popular Java and Clojure HTTP libraries.
The
api:*[ns=io.pedestal.http.http-kit] namespace adapts Pedestal to
use the xref:reference:http-kit.adoc[] library.

== Generating a Response

Whew. That was a lot to unpack from just the first three lines of
code! Let's pause for a moment to talk about the next steps. We're
making a web service that can say hello. That means we need to do some
basic things:

1. Listen to a port for incoming HTTP requests.
2. For each request, decide exactly what operations to execute, including what's in the response.
3. Stream the response back to the client.

We're going to work our way up from the bottom:

* First, the handler function that does the primary work for the request
* Next, the routing information that Pedestal uses to connect incoming requests to handler functions
* Then, the code that sets everything up and starts listening for requests

[source, clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> Define  a function, using
clj:defn[],  called `greet-handler` that takes a single argument, which we will call `_request`.
<2> Return a Clojure map with two keys and two values.

A Clojure function returns the value of the last expression in the
function. In this case, that will be the map that we construct just before
the closing paren.

[TIP]
====
Most Clojure code consists of creating, querying, and modifying these kinds of maps, so the language includes syntax to create maps very succinctly:
the curly braces mark the start and end of the map, and within are
pairs of keys and values.  Likewise, a _vector_ is marked by square brackets (`[` and `]`), general _list_ by `(` and `)`, and a set by `#{` and `}`.
====

Clojure uses dynamic typing, that means keys and values inside a map may be different types. Generally, the keys are Clojure keywords, such as :status.

The returned map has two keys and their values:

[options=header]
|===
| Key     |  Value
| :status | 200
| :body   | "Hello, world!"
|===

That's the whole thing. When our function returns that map, Pedestal
will translate the map into a full HTTP response complete appropriate
HTTP headers, including `Content-Type`.

Later on, we'll see how to take control
of the xref:hello-world-content-types.adoc[whole response]. For now, we're
just taking the easy road and let Pedestal's defaults do the work.

There's absolutely nothing special about this map. It's a plain old
Clojure map - this is typical of how Clojure operates, we don't use classes, we
use ordinary maps but care about what particular keys are in the map.
A handler function, such as `greet-handler`, returns a xref:reference:response-map.adoc[].

Clojure is a _functional language_, which means that whenever possible,
we create simple functions that have no side effects: their behavior is defined
only by the arguments passed in.

[TIP]
====
Most handlers use information in the
xref:reference:request-map.adoc[]
passed into the function,
but `greet-handler` is so trivial that it ignores the request;
the `_` prefix on the parameter name, `_request`,
is a Clojure convention for parameters that are present but purposely ignored.
====

This trivial `greet-handler` function is functional -- it can be tested entirely
by invoking it, passing in a request map, and making assertions about at the response map it returns.
There's no need to start up a server and send a request to it via HTTP, you can just
have your tests call this code directly.

That's one of the beauties of working in
Clojure and Pedestal... you can try everything interactively in a running
system. We'll see that in practice, shortly.

Next, we'll tackle what it takes to actually run the code inside the `src/hello.clj` source file.

== Managing Dependencies

Pedestal is built on the shoulders of giants, in the form of great
open source technology that many people have contributed to. That
gives us great power, but with great power comes great
dependencies. We could download all the jar files we need and string
together a classpath, but it's a huge pain. I just made a minimal
project and found 57 entries on the classpath.

This is why we _can_ have nice things, but it means we need some help
managing those dependencies. Fortunately, Clojure provides tooling for
dependency management. We'll be using the `clj` tool to run our
examples. Please take a few minutes to
link:https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli[learn more], then come
back and we'll continue.

Now we can make a `deps.edn` that tells the `clj` tool what libraries our
service needs. This goes in the main directory `hello`:


[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$hello/deps.edn[]
----
<1> Tell `clj` where our source code lives.
<2> Tell `clj` we need pedestal.http-kit and a logging library.

Pedestal isn't a single library, it's a collection of
related libraries; the primary library is
`io.pedestal/pedestal.service` which provides the `io.pedestal.connector`
namespace.  `pedestal.service` itself depends on a number of other pedestal
libraries (such as `pedestal.log` for logging results) and a number of
outside open source libraries.

Pedestal is designed to work with many different HTTP servers,
so we don't want the core library to depend on _all_ of the possible
servers out there (think of the dependencies!). Instead, we let you decide which one to use by
adding the specific library for your chosen service.

In this guide, we're using
xref:reference:http-kit.adoc[],  a fast,
stable, and minimal HTTP server. Http-Kit doesn't handle secure communications over SSL,
but it's great for local development or deployment behind a firewall that provides SSL.

Adding `io.pedestal/pedestal.http-kit` as a dependency of our hello-world
project adds the library and _all_ of its dependencies (over 40 at the
time of writing!), including `io.pedestal/pedestal.service` and many more
footnote:[Try the command `clj -Spath` to see them all.].

Let's try out our response function.

----
$ clj
Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.jetty/0.8.0/pedestal.jetty-0.8.0.pom from clojars
Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.service/0.8.0/pedestal.service-0.8.0.pom from clojars
Downloading: io/pedestal/pedestal.log/0.8.0/pedestal.log-0.8.0.pom from clojars
...
Clojure 1.12
user=>
----

[NOTE]
The downloads only occur the _first_ time you run the service; subsequently the files will already be
downloaded and ready to run.
The exact libraries and versions downloaded will vary with the exact version of Pedestal listed in
the `deps.edn` dependency.

The `clj` tool will download dependencies as needed, add them to the classpath
and start a REPL
footnote:[Read/Eval/Print/Loop.  In Clojure, you enter expressions at the prompt, and those
are parsed, executed and the result printed back to the console.  Anything you can do in a Clojure source file
can also be done right at the prompt, including redefining existing functions. REPL-oriented development is powerfully productive, especially
when combined with an IDE that can help you interact with your running REPL.]
in the `user` namespace.

Now we're able to
enter Clojure code directly and Clojure will evaluate it (turn it into a value) and print the result. The first
thing we need to do is tell Clojure to load our `hello` namespace:

----
user=> (require 'hello)
nil
user=>
----

There will be short pause as Clojure reads the `hello` namespace, then all the other namespaces
directly or indirectly required by `hello`.
The clj:require[] function returns nil on success, which the Clojure REPL printed.

If instead, you get a message like this:

[source]
----
user=> (require hello)
Syntax error compiling at (REPL:1:1).
Unable to resolve symbol: hello in this context
----

It means you missed the single-quote before "hello" in the `require`.

Now we can actually test our handler function:

----
user=> (hello/greet-handler {})
{:status 200, :body "Hello, world!\n"}
----

Well, we got the singularly unexciting result that we can call a
function and see that it returns the map that we told it to. Let's move on to
hooking this up to a route.

It's worth noting that we passed in an empty map (`{}`) rather than a full request map.
This is perfectly acceptable for testing; in fact we could have even passed a `nil` (Clojure's `null`),
as the `greet-handler` function doesn't actually use the `_request` parameter.

== Routes and Routing

In Pedestal, routing is the process of matching an incoming request to
a handler footnote:[We're simplifying here, we'll get around to discussing
_interceptors_ soon].  Essentially, the combination of the HTTP method (such as GET or POST) and
the path information in the request (such as `/greet`) should uniquely identify a _route_ and, from
that, a handler for that route.

Pedestal can easily handle dozens or even hundreds of routes, but we'll start with just one.

Let's tell Pedestal that we want the route `GET /greet` to map to our
handler function:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]
----

You probably noticed that `routes` is created with a
clj:def[] and not with a clj:defn[].

`def` is used for defining a _constant_.  The constant value is then linked to
a symbol in the namespace.  This can be a single value (such as the set provided here) or
it can be a more complex expression that gets evaluated, just once, and linked to the symbol.

`defn` is used to define a function which has parameters and a body of expressions ...
but in Clojure, a function is ultimately a kind of value.
The function gets linked to a namespace symbol.  Under the covers, the `defn` macro itself makes use of
the `def` macro.


Clojure has a xref:reference:routing-quick-reference.adoc[number of ways to express routing]; the use
of a set here (with `#{ ... }`) denotes xref:reference:table-syntax.adoc[table syntax], which is prefered.

This routing table is a single route; the route matches:

* The GET HTTP method
* The URL `/greet`

In a route definition, the first three terms are the URL to match, the HTTP method to match, and the handler for the route. After that
are key/value pairs for additional information, such as the name of the route.

When routed in a live service, the `greet-handler` function will be invoked.
In Pedestal, every route must have a unique :route-name.
We've named this route :greet.

There's an informal contract here:  Pedestal expects that `greet-handler` is a function that can accept a single parameter, a request map.  Further, it expects that, as a handler function, it will return a response map.  Violating
these rules can result in runtime exceptions.

== Hooking It All Up

We're ready for that last step: connecting the routes and handler function to an
HTTP server footnote:[Pedestal calls this a "network connector" as it is the piece that handles HTTP networking.
The network connector is an internal component of the Pedestal connector.].

We have two additional functions; one to create the Pedestal connector, and a second to create and start the connector.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=connector]
----
<1> A connector is built from a connector map; this builds an initial map with the specified port number.
<2> This step adds much basic functionality and security to the connector map.
<3> This is where routing is added to the connector map.
<4> Convert the connector map to a connector; the `nil` is a second parameter of options
specific to Http-Kit.
<5> The `start!` function starts the connector.

[TIP]
====
The clj:->[] macro is used to run a value through a series of functions; here, the result of calling
`default-connector-map` is passed to `with-default-interceptors`; the result of _that_ is passed to
`with-routes`, and so forth. This pattern is _very_ useful, concise, and common in Clojure code.
====

All we need to do now is run it.

----
user=> (require :reload 'hello)                          <1>
nil
user=> (hello/start)
#object[io.pedestal.http.http_kit$create_connector$reify__15862 0x695dc0e6 "io.pedestal.http.http_kit$create_connector$reify__15862@695dc0e6"]
----
<1> This directs Clojure to throw away the current version of the `hello` namespace and reload it from
`src/hello.clj`.

The `start!` function returns the connector (the unwieldy `#object[...]` text is how Clojure prints out
Java classes, such as the connector); the connector is now listening on port 8890.

We can test this is a second terminal window:

----
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/plain
content-length: 14
Server: Pedestal/http-kit
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:12:33 GMT

Hello, world!
----

If you look in the console after running the `curl` command, you'll see that Pedestal logged the
request:

----
user=> [] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 40}
----

It's alive! Treat yourself to a hot beverage and a high five. Whenever
you get tired of poking it, just hit kbd:[Ctrl-C] in the terminal that is
running the REPL to kill it.

== The Path So Far

We've covered a lot of ground in this guide. You have learned how to:

* Start a Pedestal project from scratch.
* Write a function to return a response.
* Define routes for Pedestal.
* Run a Http-Kit server that handles those routes.

Along the way you've also learned a bit of Clojure.

== Where to Next?

The xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[next part] in this tutorial adds
the ability to receive a query parameter, apply logic to it, and
return a different response for an error.
