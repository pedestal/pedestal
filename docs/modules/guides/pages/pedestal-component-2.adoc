# Pedestal with Component (Redux)
:default_api_ns: io.pedestal.interceptor

As you imagine a xref:pedestal-with-component.adoc[Component-based Pedestal application] expanding
its functionality, you might expect to see some growing pains.

At the center of the system is the :components component that, in a fully-featured application, can be
expected to grow into a ever-expanding grab-bag of dependencies. This is a
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern#Big_ball_of_mud[Big Ball of Mud]" - a design
antipattern that Component was created to avoid.

The theory and practice of Component is that each component
gets exactly the dependencies it specifically needs ... no more.

Pedestal has optional capabilities to define interceptors and handlers as components, each with
individual dependencies. By embracing this approach, we end up with a more focused system map:

[graphviz]
----
digraph G {
 ":pedestal" -> ":route-source";
 ":route-source" -> ":handler/get-greeting" [label=":get-greeting"];
 ":handler/get-greeting" -> ":greeter";
}
----

Again, with this tiny toy of an application, the structure is quite flat, but one can imagine
a real system with dozens of endpoints, complex interceptors, and many different components for different
aspects of the overall application.

Before we get started on how a revised version of the application is implemented, there are some tradeoffs to consider:

- Greater complexity: more components and more dependencies
- Reloading is for _functions_ not _objects_
- Debugging into methods is harder footnote:[This is my personal experience using Cursive and IntelliJ.  Often, it is not possible to set breakpoints inside methods.]

To expand on that reloading issue: when you reload namespace changes, all functions and values are revaluated and
replaced. For functions, the fully qualified function name will be shared between the old code and the new.

For Clojure records, after reloading namespaces, the old record _instance_ (in the system map) will still be in place, with the old JVM class for that instance. So, changing the implementation of
a method of a record will _not_ see any effect, at least until the system map is rebuilt and restarted.

So, keep those concerns in mind while we describe the revised application.
This time, we can build from the bottom up, starting with the greeter component.

## :greeter component

[source,clojure]
.src/app/components/greeter.clj
----
include::example$component2/src/app/components/greeter.clj[]
----

This namespace is unchanged from the prior guide.

## handlers namespace

A new namespace, for components that are interceptors or handlers, has been
created.

[source,clojure]
.src/app/components/handlers.clj
----
include::example$component2/src/app/components/handlers.clj[]
----
<1> api:definterceptor[] extends the behavior of clj:defrecord[].
<2> As with a record, we start with fields of the record.
<3> The `handle` method is allowed and `definterceptor` automatically adds the correspondng api:Handler[] protocol.
<4> The implementation can directly reference the `greeter` field.
<5> It's always good form to provide a function to create a new component instance.

The `definterceptor` macro streamlines the process of creating a record type for a component; when it sees particular method names (`handle`, `enter`, `leave`, or `error`) it automatically adds the corresponding protocol (api:Handler[],
api:OnEnter[], api:OnLeave[], or api:OnError[]).  This allows interceptors defined this way to be very concise.

`definterceptor` also quietly adds an implementation of api:IntoInterceptor[]; `definterceptor` provides :enter, :leave, and :error keys
as necessary, to match the protocols; the functions automatically invoke the corresponding method.  It _just works_.

## routes namespace

Next up the component heirarchy is the component used to generate the application's
routes. The component depends on the handlers and other interceptor components that are referenced
in the routes.

[source,clojure]
.src/app/routes.clj
----
include::example$component2/src/app/routes.clj[]
----
<1> Amazingly, no dependencies are needed for this namespace.
<2> The `routes` function is provided with the RoutesSource component and can extract the `get-greeting` dependency.
<3> The :route-name option can now be omitted, and the name of the interceptor is used as the route name.

## pedestal namespace

In the previous version, the :pedestal component defined routes and added the dependency-injecting component; in
this version, the component obtains the routes from the :route-source component.

[source,clojure]
.src/app/pedestal.clj
----
include::example$component2/src/app/pedestal.clj[]
----
<1> The component has a dependency on `route-source`, and manages the `connector` field.
<2> This is where the :route-source component is used.

## system namespace

This all comes together in the `app.system` namespace where all components
and dependencies get declared:

[source,clojure]
.src/app/system.clj
----
include::example$component2/src/app/system.clj[]
----
<1> A simple, empty map can be used as a component when it doesn't implement `Lifeycle` or some other protocol.
<2> A map can be used to define dependencies when the local key does not match the system map key.

## Other code

All the other namespaces (primarily, the tests) are unchanged between the two
versions of the application.

== The Path So Far

In this guide we extended the prior application to fully leverage the capabilities
of the Component library. We demonstrated how the `definterceptor` macro streamlines
creating components that act as both components and interceptors (or handlers), and we saw how each component
can have only explicit dependencies on exactly what other components it directly interacts with.
