= Using Pedestal With Component

link:{component_home}[Component] is a popular and non-intrusive library for organizing
Clojure logic; it makes it easy to define _components_, as maps or Clojure records, and organize them, with inter-component
dependencies,
into a _system map_.

It's not uncommon for Pedestal to be setup to operate as one component within a Component system.

TIP: This guide is a bit longer than the previous ones, but no single file or function is itself very long.
The point of using Component is to adopt a structure that scales up to higher levels of complexity, and that
requires a bit of connective tissue between the essential code snippets of the application.

== What You Will Learn
After reading this guide you will be able to:

- Create a Component-based service using Pedestal.
- Make updates to your service without restarting your REPL.
- Test your service using Pedestal's test helpers.

== Guide Assumptions
This guide is for users who are familiar with:

- Clojure
- Pedestal
- Clojure's CLI tooling
- Component

If you are new to Pedestal, you may want to go back to the
xref:hello-world.adoc[] guide.

If you're new to Component, you
should definitely link:{component_home}[check it out] first.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we're going to step through creating a Pedestal service
using Component. We'll start off by creating a Pedestal component and
wire it into a Component system map. We'll then proceed to testing our
service.

== Before We Begin

We are going to have a component that manages the Pedestal connector.
A second component will be a "big bag of components" that will be provided
to every interceptor or handler function in a new :components key of the
xref:reference:request-map.adoc[].  We'll also have a component with some mutable
state to interact with from our handler.

We can represent the system map as a diagram, showing components and their dependencies:

[graphviz]
----
digraph G {
 ":pedestal" -> ":components";
 ":components" -> ":greeter";
}
----

This is a very flat map; it shows that the :pedestal component
depends on the :components component, which itself depends on
the :greeter component.

What's the point of the :components component? It represents
a subset of components that will be made available to interceptors and handlers.
There's curerntly only a single component inside :components now, but in a realistic application,
there would be many such dependencies.

Real systems built with the Component library will often have dozens of
components and even more dependencies, but this small start still demonstrates
a valid pattern.

Now that we have a better idea of the system layout, let's start building the project and wiring the components together.

== Project and Dependencies

The first step is to create a project directory to contain the project sources,
then create a `deps.edn` file, to capture the dependencies of our application.

[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$component/deps.edn[]
----
<1> We'll need this library later.
<2> This will be used inside our tests.
<3> This makes it possible to reload changed namespaces quickly and easily, using the {clj-reload} library.
<4> This will be used to enable xref:reference:dev-mode.adoc[], which makes developing at the REPL easier.

== Component System Map

We're going to build the application top-down, starting with the system map.
footnote:[This isn't actually fair. The application was originally built bottom up, a little bit at a time. It's just easier to understand
when described top to bottom.]

The `app.system` namespace it the highest structure in the application; it defines all the
components in the system, and how they depend on each other.

Create a `src` directory, and then an `app` directory beneath that.  That's where more of our project's code will live.

[source, clojure]
.src/app/system.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/system.clj[tag=ns]
----
<1> These two namespaces haven't been written yet.

The `system-map` function defines a Component SystemMap in terms of key and value pairs.
Each key is a keyword, and each value is a map or Clojure record.  The `using` function
identifies on which other components each component depends.

Let's work on the Pedestal component next.

== Pedestal Component

The :pedestal component will be responsible for configuring the Pedestal connector, and starting it.

[source, clojure]
.src/app/pedestal.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/pedestal.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> We need to require `com.stuartsierra.component`  namespace to make the
`start` and `stop` Lifecycle methods available.
<2> This, _once created_, will define routes and handlers for the application.

=== Component Injection

Earlier we said that we want to make certain components of the system map available to interceptors
and handlers; we'll define a custom interceptor for that purpose:

[source, clojure]
.src/app/pedestal.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/pedestal.clj[tags=inject]
----

This is actually a function that _returns_ an interceptor.
When that interceptor is eventually executed in the :enter phase,
it will modify the context map passed to it, injecting the components map into the request map for later
access.  Where does the map of components come from?  We're almost there.

=== Lifecycle Protocol

Let's start implementing the :pedestal component, as a Clojure record type.

A Clojure record is a Clojure map that has certain built-in fields; in addition,
a record can extend Clojure protocols. The result is a new class. The fields
of the record are typically used to store dependencies and any local state, mutable or otherwise.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/src/app/pedestal.clj[tags=component]
)
----
<1> Define the Pedestal record. This record will contain a `components` field, whose value
will be supplied as another component from the system, and a `connector` field, managed by the Pedestal component itself.
<2> Include the _component/Lifecycle_ protocol since we'll be
implementing its methods next.

We'll first implement the `start` method of the `Lifecycle` protocol. It will contain our
component initialization code.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/src/app/pedestal.clj[tags=start]
----
<1> We're adding the Pedestal connector to the component.
<2> Create and add the ::inject-components interceptor to the very start of the interceptor list.
<3> If the process was started in xref:reference:dev-mode.adoc[], add additional development-only interceptors.
<4> We haven't defined the `app.route/routes` value yet.
<5> Convert from a connector map to an (unstarted) connector.

This `start` method goes _inside_ `defrecord`, after the `components/Lifecycle` line.

[TIP]
.Every `start` deserves a `stop`
====
You might think that there's no need to add the `stop` method, since the
service will run until it's process is killed.

That _may_ be true in production, but in development and testing, this may not be the case.

You should always _undo_, in `stop`, the changes made in `start`.
In this example, we need to make sure that the Pedestal connector is stopped,
or we could end up with a zombie thread keeping port 8890 locked.
Generally, our tests create a new system map, start it, run tests, then stop it ...
but Component can also handle cases where the system map is created _once_ and repeatedly started and stopped.
====

Now let's implement the `stop` method. It will contain our component
teardown code.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/src/app/pedestal.clj[tags=stop]
----

Most importantly here, we `stop!` the Pedestal connector; this ensure that port 8890 is no longer bound.
That's pretty important later, when we want to work with REPL-oriented development.

[CAUTION]
.Don't `dissoc` in `stop`
====
If we used clj:dissoc[] here (instead of `assoc` with value  `nil`), we would be removing a record key from a record; Clojure would quietly
convert from a Pedestal record to a standard Clojure map. This isn't a big deal, unless we try to start and stop
the same system map repeatedly; the second start would not work correctly because the Clojure map has no `start` method.
====

Now that we've got our component, we need a way to
create and initialize an instance of it. Let's tackle that next:
----
include::example$component/src/app/pedestal.clj[tags=constructor]
----
Our component constructor is just a wrapper around the map-specific
record constructor created by `defrecord`. The `defrecord` macro
creates a number of constructors and any of them could be used here.

[TIP]
It's common to create a simple wrapper function, as shown here; quite often,
components grow to need additional setup and initialization which can occur in this kind of
creation function.

A service that doesn't define any routes is not particularly useful so our next step is to provide at least one route.

== Defining Routes

The :pedestal component expects the symbol `app.routes/routes` to be the routes for the application.
Let's create that file now.

We're going to define an endpoint for `GET /greet`; it will return a dynamic string: "Greeting #1", then "Greeting #2" and so forth on later requests.

Let's get started:

Create a `src/app/routes.clj` file. This file will contain our routes and
handlers. Well, just the one, because this is a toy example.

[source, clojure]
.src/app/routes.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/routes.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> Remember, we haven't defined this component yet.
<2> The :components map provided by the ::inject-components interceptor.


That's the handler, lets define the route that maps to the handler:

----
include::example$component/src/app/routes.clj[tags=routes]
----

[TIP]
In this simple example, we use `def`, not `defn`, as the routes are entirely static.
In many applications, some parts of the routes would be more dynamic, and `routes`
would be a function with arguments.

== Greeter Component

The best handlers in a Pedestal application are very simple, dealing with the Pedestal logic and the structure
of the request and response maps, with all the real application-specific logic in a component or function.

In our case, we have a :greeter component that builds the response body.  Let's create that now.

[source, clojure]
.src/app/components/greeter.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/components/greeter.clj[tags=gen-preamble]
----
<1> Ignore this for now.

That's the component and its lifecycle, including a place to store some internal state ... how many times
the greeting was retrieved.  Next we can focus on the actual logic:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/src/app/components/greeter.clj[tags=gen1]
----
<1> Another Clojure naming convention: _impure_ functions in Clojure are suffixed with a `!`.
footnote:[Impure functions can vary their result even when provided with the same input. Pure functions always return
 the same value for the same inputs.  Functions may be impure because they
have hidden mutable state, or because they perform some kind of I/O - even something as minor are reading the system clock.]

We're just about ready to fire this puppy up and kick the tires!
footnote:[Sorry for the mixed metaphor.]

== User Namespace

Technically, we have enough now to run our service, but for ease of use, we're going to add a `user` namespace.
At startup, Clojure always loads the `user` namespace if it is available.

Create a `test` directory in the project root, and a `user.clj` within it.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/test/user.clj[]
----
<1> This is required to make use of {clj-reload}, which is key to REPL oriented development.
<2> The system map will be stored in this global atom.

Ok, *now* let's fire up these tires up and kick the puppy!

== Running The Application

We'll use `clj` tool to run our
example. This should be familiar to you if you read through the
xref:hello-world.adoc[].

From the project's root directory, fire up a REPL, and start the system.
----
$ clj -A:test:dev-mode <1>
Clojure 1.12.0
user=> (start!) <2>
Routing table:
┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓ <3>
┃ Method ┃  Path  ┃  Name  ┃
┣━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━┫
┃   :get ┃ /greet ┃ :greet ┃
┗━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━┛
#<SystemMap> <4>
user=>
----

<1> The :test alias adds the `test` directory and some other dependencies to the classpath. The :dev-mode alias enables development mode.
<2> Here's that handy command from `user.clj`.
<3> In development mode, the routing table is printed to the console at startup (and whenever a change is detected).
footnote:[Also, in the console it prints correctly: the verticle bars align properly and connect. It looks a bit jarring here.]
<4> This is the printed representation of the Component system map.

You can now interact with the started service. Start a second terminal window and use `curl` to access the `/greet` route:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Greeting #1
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Greeting #2
$
----

That's what we want to see!

You'll also see messages in the console of the server REPL:

----
[] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 40}
[] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 40}
----

These messages are quite minimal because we haven't configured logging in any way.

Two important areas remain: REPL oriented development, and testing.  Let's start by getting a feel for how awesome the Clojure REPL is.

== REPL oriented development

Let's see if we can get a prettier response to the client.

The body of the response is inside the Greeter component, so only that needs to change:

[source,clojure]
.src/app/components/greeter.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/components/greeter.clj[tags=gen2]
----
<1> `ordinal` returns "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th", etc.

Just changing the source doesn't affect the running program, but we can use {clj-reload} to load the changes.

[source]
----
user=> (clj-reload.core/reload)
Unloading user
Unloading app.system
Unloading app.pedestal
Unloading app.routes
Unloading app.components.greeter
Loading app.components.greeter
Loading app.routes
Loading app.pedestal
Loading app.system
Loading user
Reloaded 5 namespaces in 54 ms
{:unloaded [user app.system app.pedestal app.routes app.components.greeter], :loaded [app.components.greeter app.routes app.pedestal app.system user]}
user=>
----

clj-reload has identified which files have changed, and has unloaded and reloaded all files affected by the changes.  The code, including the system map and the Pedestal connector inside the :pedestal component, continues to run; it isn't even necessary to `stop!` and `start!` the service.

[source]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Greetings for the 3rd time
----

Because it's the 3rd request, we get the expected response. Even though code reloaded, the system map is unchanged, and the internal state of the :greeter component isn't affected ... just the functions and other symbols defined in re-loaded namespaces has changed.

We can also modify our routes, giving our API a different URL:

[source,clojure]
.src/app/routes.clj
----
include::example$component/src/app/routes.clj[tags=routes2]
----

Again, reload namespaces, then:

[source]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Not Found
----

That's actually successful ... we've changed our routes to respond to `/api/greet`, so the URL `/greet` is met with a 404 Not Found response.


If you look in your REPL window, you'll see that your change has been adopted, and the new routing table printed:

[source]
----
[] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 40}
Routing table:
┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Method ┃    Path    ┃  Name  ┃
┣━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━━━━━╋━━━━━━━━┫
┃   :get ┃ /api/greet ┃ :greet ┃
┗━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━━━━━┻━━━━━━━━┛
----

Using the correct URL gets the expected result:

[source]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/api/greet
Greetings for the 4th time
----

At this point, we've seen that we can iterate quickly when in development mode.
You should be aware that when running a system map when development mode is *not expressly enabled*
you will see that Pedestal gets "locked in" to the routes and many function definitions,
even after code is changed and reloaded ... you'll often have to `(stop!)` and `(start!)` to see the effects of reloading namespaces.

Fortunately, starting and stopping the system map is very quick, which is important when it comes to the next subject ... testing.

== Testing

Let's move on to testing our new service. Recall that our service contains one
route, `GET /api/greet`. We'd like to verify that a request to that endpoints returns the proper
greeting response.

Before we can jump in and do that, though, we need to create
some helpers. Some are just useful in general, while others are
specific to our component implementation. Don't worry, you won't have
to write too much code. Let's do it!

First create a `system_test.clj` file in the `src` directory.

[source,clojure]
.test/app/system_test.clj
----
include::example$component/test/app/system_test.clj[tags=ns]
----

The `app.system-test` namespace requires all the dependencies
necessary for testing.

We'll make use of the api:*[ns=io.pedestal.connector.test] namespace, which contains
functions to make it easier to integration test a Pedestal application.
We'll also make use of {matcher-combinators},
a testing library that makes it easy to make assertions about complex data, such as a response map.

=== Create and manage the system

To integration test a system, we must be able to create and start the application's system map, and ensure it is shut down at the end of each test.

In a full application we'd expect to do this constantly, and this is a place where a Clojure
macro can be handy.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/test/app/system_test.clj[tag=with-system]
----

This macro makes it possible to create the system from any expression, assigning it
to a local symbol that can be referenced in the body of the macro.

This system is the base for the next part, a helper for running a request.

=== Run a request

Our second helper is used to test a request, returning a response.  It's built
on top of the api:response-for[ns=io.pedestal.connector.test] function.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$component/test/app/system_test.clj[tag=response]
----

The api:response-for[ns=io.pedestal.connector.test] function needs the Pedestal connector, which is available from the
system map. With the connector, the method (such as :get), the URL, and any additional arguments, `response` can exercise your Pedestal application
almost exactly as it would when receiving a real HTTP request ... just no HTTP is involved.

`response-for` uses the interceptor chain to execute a request map (built from the arguments)
as if it had arrived via HTTP, and returns a response map.

Now that we've got our helpers implemented, let's move on to our
test.

[#testing]
=== Test

The test will exercise the `GET /api/greet` route of the application.

----
include::example$component/test/app/system_test.clj[tags=test]
))
----
<1> Now we see why the `with-system` macro is so useful.
<2> The `(is (match? ...))` is provided by matcher-combinators.
<3> The `response` function makes it simple to run the request.

Now let's run the tests from the command line:

[source]
----
$ clj -X:test

Running tests in #{"test"}

Testing app.system-test
[main] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /api/greet", :line 40}

Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
$
----

We can run that test any number of times, and because the system is started fresh each time,
it will always be the "1st" greeting.

We should check that the :greeting component's state is working correctly.
Add an assertion for a new request just after the first:

----
include::example$component/test/app/system_test.clj[tags=test2]
----
<1> `via` is used to transform the actual response body before comparing it to the expected body

Run it again to see both assertions execute:

[source]
----
$ clj -X:test

Running tests in #{"test"}

Testing app.system-test
[main] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /api/greet", :line 40}
[main] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /api/greet", :line 40}

Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
----

=== What failure looks like

Before we wrap up, we should take a quick peek at what failures look like.
Changing the word "2nd" to "second" in our test code will result in a test failure:

[source]
----
$ clj -X:test

Running tests in #{"test"}

Testing app.system-test
[main] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /api/greet", :line 40}
[main] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /api/greet", :line 40}

FAIL in (greeting-test) (system_test.clj:34)
expected: (match? {:status 200, :body (m/via string/trim "Greetings for the second time")} (response system :get "/api/greet"))
  actual: {:status 200,
 :body
 (mismatch
  (expected "Greetings for the second time")
  (actual "Greetings for the 2nd time")),
 :headers
 {:strict-transport-security "max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains",
  :x-frame-options "DENY",
  :x-content-type-options "nosniff",
  :x-xss-protection "1; mode=block",
  :x-download-options "noopen",
  :x-permitted-cross-domain-policies "none",
  :content-security-policy
  "object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;",
  :content-type "text/plain"}}
...
$
----

On a failure. matcher-combinators does a good job of describing exactly what failed and what the actual data provided was.  It's not visible here, but the console output even includes
some colors, red vs. green, to highlight what's wrong vs. what was expected.

And that brings us to the end of this guide.

== The Path So Far

At the beginning of this guide, we set out to create a Pedestal
component, demonstrate its usage as well as how to test it without
starting the http server. In the process, we also introduced a few general purpose
test helpers.

Keep in mind that Pedestal services are highly configurable. It's
important to separate that configuration from the core component
implementation. By limiting our component's responsibilities to an HTTP
server with Pedestal providing life cycle support, we can use it in a
wide variety of Pedestal implementations.
