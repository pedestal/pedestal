= Using Pedestal With Component

link:{component_home}[Component] is a popular and non-intrusive library for organizing
Clojure logic; it makes it easy to define _components_, as maps or Clojure records, and organize them, with intra-component
dependencies,
into a _system map_.

It's not uncommon for Pedestal to be setup to operate as a component with a Component system.

== What You Will Learn
After reading this guide you will be able to:

- Create a Component-based service using Pedestal.
- Test your service using Pedestal's test helpers.

== Guide Assumptions
This guide is for users who are familiar with:

- Clojure
- Pedestal
- Clojure's CLI tooling
- Component


If you are new to Pedestal, you may want to go back to the
xref:hello-world.adoc[] guide.

If you're new to Component, you
should definitely link:{component_home}[check it
out] first.

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we're going to step through creating a Pedestal service
using Component. We'll start off by creating a Pedestal component and
wire it into a Component system map. We'll then proceed to testing our
service.

== Before We Begin

We'll limit our component's responsibilities to lifecycle management
of the Pedestal HTTP server and provider. We'll also expose the
Pedestal service function (:io.pedestal.http/service-fn) upon
component initialization as a convenience for testing.

Route or interceptor management will not be a component responsibility
because the management of routes/interceptors is more of an
application-specific concern. This may be familiar to you if you
studied the way the Pedestal _lein template_ lays out a Pedestal
service - routes, interceptors and configuration is kept separate from
service plumbing.

Finally, Pedestal service configuration, captured via a
xref:reference:service-map.adoc[], will be a component dependency.

Now that we have a better idea of what we want our component to do,
let's go build it!


== Initial Project

The first step is to create a project directory to contain the project sources,
then create a `deps.edn` file, to capture the dependencies of our application.

[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$component/deps.edn[]
----

== A Simple Pedestal Component

Next, create a `src` directory, and a `pedestal.clj` file within it:

[source, clojure]
.src/pedestal.clj

----
include::example$component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> Create a `pedestal` namespace to house the Pedestal component.
<2> We need to require `com.stuartsierra.component`  namespace to make the
`start` and `stop` Lifecycle methods available.
<3> We need to require the `io.pedestal.http` namespace for server creation,
starting and stopping.

Let's start implementing the component:
----
include::example$component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=component-init]
----
<1> Create a Pedestal record. This record will contain a `service-map` field, whose value
will be supplied from another component, and a `server` field, managed by the Pedestal component, which is
the server created from the service map.
<2> Include the _component/Lifecycle_ protocol since we'll be
implementing its methods next.

We'll first implement the `start` method. It will contain our
component initialization code.
----
include::example$component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=component-start]
----
<1> If the service is already running (because you mistakenly invoked `component/start-system`
on an already started system), let it keep running{empty}footnote:[This is useful for
 REPL-driven development, where mistakes happen. Without it, you may end up with a "zombie" Pedestal component and Jetty service keeping the port bound.].
<2> Update the `service` field of the Pedestal component with the newly created,
and optionally started, service.
<3> api:create-server[] returns a server map, which can be started via api:start[].
<4> In test mode, don't start the server (the HTTP part), but we'll still be able to
feed requests into the interceptor pipeline.

If you've read some of the other guides, this implementation should
look somewhat familiar. It's a combination of the server-specific code
used in the xref:hello-world.adoc[] guide.

****
Before we go on, remember the `test?` function? It's idiomatic in
Pedestal services to include an :env key in the service map to communicate the environment of the service. This
currently does not affect the behavior of the service, but it's a
useful marker. Our component will leverage this idiom and will not
start/stop the server if the service is configured for the test
environment. The implementation is included below.
----
include::example$component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=test?]
----
****

Now let's implement the `stop` method. It will contain our component
teardown code.
----
include::example$component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=component-stop]
----
<1> Like `start`, `stop` will be idempotent. If the component has been
initialized and we're not working with the test environment, we'll
pass the initialized service map to the stop function.
<2> Return the component with the `service` field set to `nil`. You
can't use `dissoc` here since it would return a plain map, breaking
the component by converting it from a Pedestal record to a plain Clojure map.

Now that we've got our component, we need a way to
create and initialize an instance of it. Let's tackle that next:
----
include::example$component/src/pedestal.clj[tags=constructor]
----
Our component constructor is just a wrapper around the map-specific
record constructor created by `defrecord`. The `defrecord` macro
creates a number of constructors and any of them could be used here.

[TIP]
It's common to create a simple wrapper function, as shown here; quite often,
components grow to need additional setup and initialization which can occur in this kind of
creation function.

Now that we've got our Pedestal component, let's proceed to wiring it
into a full-fledged system.

== Wiring it up
Create a `routes.clj` file. This file will contain our routes and
handlers.

[source, clojure]
.src/routes.clj

----
include::example$component/src/routes.clj[tags=response]
----
The `respond-hello` handler returns a simple static response. It may
look familiar since it made its first appearance in
the xref:hello-world.adoc[] guide.

Finally, let's implement the routes.
----
include::example$component/src/routes.clj[tags=routes]
----
We'll implement a single route, `GET /greet`, using Pedestal's tabular
routing syntax.

[TIP]
In this simple example, we use `def`, as the routes are entirely static.
In many applications, some parts of the routes would be more dynamic, and `routes`
would be a function with arguments.

Now that we've got our Pedestal Component and routes, we can wire
them up in a Component system map.

Create a `system.clj` file. This file will contain our system map and
system constructor.

[source, clojure]
.src/system.clj
----
include::example$component/src/system.clj[tags=ns]
----
<1> Require `com.stuartsierra.component`. It will be used to 
create the Component system map.
<2> Require `component.repl` for its system management functions. You would
normally do this in a `dev` namespace.
<3> Require `io.pedestal.http` for the server `start` and `stop` functions.
<4> Require `pedestal` for the Pedestal component.
<5> Require `routes` for the application routes.

Let's create a system initialization function named _system_.
----
include::example$component/src/system.clj[tags=app]
----
<1> It will take the system environment as a single parameter. We'll
use keywords like :prod or :test for this.
<2> The system map will contain a :service-map key whose value is
a Pedestal service map. This is still a component, even though it is purely data.
<3> The service map's :env key will map to our environment keyword.
<4> We'll configure the service map with our app-specific routes.
<5> The system map will contain a :pedestal key whose value is an
uninitialized Pedestal component.
<6> The Pedestal component depends on the service map, so we will capture
that dependency with `component/using`.

The next step sets up the use of the
link:https://github.com/stuartsierra/component.repl[component.repl] library.

[source,clojure]
include::example$component/src/system.clj[tags=init]

The `set-init` function stores a function that is used to start (or restart) the system.
When `start` or `reset` is invoked, this function is passed the old system (or nil if there is no old system),
and the function returns the new, but unstarted, system.


== Running It

We'll use `clj` tool to run our
example. This should be familiar to you if you read through the
xref:hello-world.adoc[].

From the project's root directory, fire up a repl, and start the system.

The Component design pattern ensures that the system is in the correct state no
matter how many times we do this.


== Testing
Let's move on to testing our new service. Recall that our service contains one
route, `GET /greet`. We'd like to verify that it returns the proper
greeting. Before we can jump in and do that, though, we need to create
some helpers. Some are just useful in general, while others are
specific to our component implementation. Don't worry, you won't have
to write too much code. Let's do it!

First create a `system_test.clj` file in the `src` directory.

[source, clojure]
.test/system_test.clj

----
include::example$component/test/system_test.clj[tags=ns]
----
The `system-test` namespace requires all the dependencies
necessary for testing.

Now let's get to those helpers.

The `url-for` helper allows us to refer to routes by
_route-name_. This is very useful, and is almost always adapted into new projects.
----
include::example$component/test/system_test.clj[tags=url-for]
----
We need to expand the routes before invoking Pedestal's
api:url-for-routes[ns=io.pedestal.http.route] function.

The end result is that `url-for` is a function

The `service-fn` helper extracts the Pedestal ::http/service-fn from
the started system. This helper allows us to keep focus on our
tests rather than test initialization.
----
include::example$component/test/system_test.clj[tags=service-fn]
----


The `with-system` macro allows us to start/stop systems between test
executions. We'll model its design on macros like `with-open` and
`with-redefs` so that its shape and usage is familiar.
----
include::example$component/test/system_test.clj[tags=with-system]
----

Now that we've got our helpers implemented, let's move on to our
test. Create a test named `greeting-test`.
----
include::example$component/test/system_test.clj[tags=test]
----
<1> `sut` (for _system under test_) will be bound to the started
system by `with-system`. Notice how :test is passed as the system
environment key; this ensures that the server does not start, and no HTTP port is bound.
<2> Use the `service-fn` helper to extract the Pedestal service
function from the started system.
<3> Use Pedestal's `response-for` test helper to make a test request
to the :greet route. Use the `url-for` helper to refer to the route
by name.
<4> We should get back a '200' status.
<5> We should get back a response body of 'Hello, world!'

Now let's restart run the tests from the command line:
----
> clj -T:tests run

Running tests in #{"test"}

Testing system-test
[main] INFO io.pedestal.http - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 90}

Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
>
----

That's it! You now know the fundamentals necessary for implementing
and testing your Component-based Pedestal services.

== The Path So Far
At the beginning of this guide, we set out to create a Pedestal
component, demonstrate its usage as well as how to test it without
starting the http server. In the process, we also introduced a few general purpose
test helpers.

Keep in mind that Pedestal services are highly configurable. It's
important to separate that configuration from the core component
implementation. By limiting our component's responsibilities to http
server and Pedestal provider life cycle support, we can use it in a
wide variety of Pedestal implementations.
