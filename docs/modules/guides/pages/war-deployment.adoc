= WAR Deployment
:experimental:

Pedestals primary mode of deployment is _embedded_: the Pedestal application starts up and,
along the way, launches a servlet container (such as xref:reference:jetty.adoc[]) and configures it to receive
requests and process them.

An alternate, and older, approach is to bundle the application as a WAR (Web Archive) file and deploy that
into a running servlet container.  Although there's far less call for this kind of multi-tenant application hosting
in modern times (since the advent of
https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
containers and other kinds of virtualization), this is a long term
feature of Pedestal that is still supported.


In this deployment mode, the servlet container will instantiate an instance of a Pedestal-provided
servlet class; when the servlet initializes, it will create a bridge from the Servlet world into the Pedestal world.
We'll cover the details below.

== Overview

In this guide we'll show a very simple application, yet another "hello world" service.

We'll show how to package up the application's sources, resources, and library dependencies into a WAR file.

Finally, we'll demonstrate how to deploy the WAR file into a Jetty service running inside a Docker container.

You'll need to have Docker installed as part of this guide.

== Structure of a WAR File

We've mentioned deployments and WAR files, so let's detour into some more specifics about what a WAR file actually is.

A WAR file is an archive file, like a .zip or .jar file, with a particular structure.

* `WEB-INF/web.xml` -- file: deployment descriptor needed by the container
* `WEB-INF/classes` -- directory of resource files and compiled Clojure namespaces
* `WEB-INF/lib` -- directory containing additional libraries that are needed by the application, such as Clojure and Pedestal

This structure provides the servlet container with the information it needs to set up a classloader specifically for the deployed WAR file, and direct incoming HTTP requests into it.

== Dependencies

As with the other guides, we'll define the dependencies of our project using a `deps.edn` file.


[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$war/deps.edn[]
----
<1> WebSocket classes must be included even if not used by the application.
<2> Used when compiling the project into a WAR file.

The main dependency is on `io.pedestal/pedestal.servlet`; all other necessary Pedestal dependencies
are provided as transitive dependencies from this.  `pedestal.servlet`
is not linked to any particular implementation of the Servlet API.

In a servlet container deployment, the WAR file normally does _not_ have dependencies on
the Servlet API; the servlet container, which has control over the classpath of the deployed
WAR, adds the Servlet API in automatically.  `pedestal.servlet` does not have a dependency on
the Servlet API
--- well, actually, it does under development and when compiling some Java classes, but it doesn't
export those dependencies to projects like this one.

However, using WebSockets is different
footnote:[Perhaps because they were introduced relatively recently.]
and if the WAR file makes use of WebSockets it _must_ include the WebSocket API (mostly interfaces)
and implementation files (classes implementing those interfaces).  These should be matched to the
servlet container, so we're using the Jetty implementations here.

Even though this application doesn't use WebSockets, the Pedestal libraries _do_ have WebSocket support built-in, so these dependencies must be included, even if they won't be actively used.

== Clojure Service

[source,clojure]
.src/org/example/war/service.clj
----
include::example$war/src/org/example/war/service.clj[]
----

Our application is very simple, it responds to the URL `GET /hello` and responds with a snippet of text.

This is all the code for our application (!) --- we've skimped on writing tests.

The `connection-map` function is used to create a connection map as if we were going to
create a xref:reference:connector.adoc[] ... but we stop short.  In fact, all we really care
about at the end are the :interceptors and :initial-context keys of this connection map.

The magic happens in the `create-bridge` function; this will be invoked from the
servlet to create the ConnectorBridge object.  The
api:create-bridge[ns=io.pedestal.connector.servlet] function does the heavy lifting.

This bridge object has a `service` method that is passed the HttpServletRequest
and HttpServletResponse and does all the Pedestal-related processing.

== Deployment Descriptor

[source,xml]
.web.xml
----
include::example$war/web.xml[]
----

Inside all this XML are three basic constructors:

- The servlet handles _every_ request passed to it (that's the `/*`)
- The servlet is class ConnectorServlet, provided by the `pedestal-servlet` library
- The servlet invokesthe function `org.example.war.service/create-bridge` when it initializes

So, the request comes into the Jetty servlet container and it decides which WAR deployment it belongs to, then which servlet _inside_ the WAR deployment is responsible, then asks the servlet
to do the work, which passes through the ConnectorBridge and into Pedestal to do the actual work.

== Creating the WAR file

To create a WAR file, we need to package up the sources, the deployment descriptor, and any
libraries, such as `pedestal.servlet` (and all the its transitive dependencies). We can do this
in a quick-and-dirty style using a small amount of Clojure code.

When we discussed dependencies, there was a :build alias: this build alias sets up `build`
as a classpath root, and brings in dependencies on `io.github.clojure/tools.build` (for reading
the `deps.edn` file) and `babashka/fs` (for copying files and building archives).

[source,xml]
.build/build.clj
----
include::example$war/build/build.clj[]
----
<1> Create the _basis_
<2> Iterate over the classpath entries and copy them into the working directory
<3> Zip up the working directory to create the WAR file

A _basis_ is a fully expanded definition of the contents of the `deps.edn` file, including all
the source roots, direct dependencies, and transitive dependencies.  We use all that to copy
files to a working directory, and then we package it all together as a WAR file.

The command `clojure -T:build war` will run this code:

```
$ clojure -T:build war
Copying cheshire-6.0.0.jar
Copying transit-clj-1.0.333.jar
Copying transit-java-1.0.371.jar
Copying jackson-core-2.18.3.jar
...
Copying ring-core-1.14.1.jar
Copying tigris-0.1.2.jar
Copying resources
Copying src
Copying web.xml
Created target/app.war
$
```

NOTE: The first time through it may take some time to download the 13 MB of dependencies.

This is just a minimal example; a more complete version might:

* https://clojure.org/reference/compilation[AOT-compile] your application and its dependencies
* Generate the web.xml file automatically
* Package up static resources that Jetty can serve automatically, outside of Pedestal
* Add other servlets or servlet filters to augment what Pedestal is doing


Now that we have a WAR file, we can show how to deploy it.

== Docker and Jetty

We'll make use of Docker to simplify deployment ... really, to not leave a mess on your
computer after we're done.


[source]
.Dockerfile
----
include::example$war/Dockerfile[]
----

A Dockerfile describes how to build a Docker image -- a snapshot of a virtual computer
running some kind of Linux with everything installed and configured and ready to go.
Most of the work was done for us in the image we extend from, and standard jetty 12 image.

It's just a matter of enabling WAR deployments and copying the `app.war` file into the image.

The WAR files go in the `/var/lib/jetty/webapps` folder inside the Docker image, and the special
name `ROOT.war` is recognized by Jetty as a WAR file that deploys without any kind of prefix
on the path.

You can build this manually with `docker build ...`, and run it with `docker run ...` ...
but our final step is to show a simple script file that puts all the pieces together

== Running Jetty

To simplify things, we'll provide a script that puts everything together and ensures that Jetty is running:

[source,bash]
.run.sh
----
include::example$war/run.sh[]
----

This script builds the WAR file, then builds the Docker image and tags it as `war-demo`.
Finally, it starts Docker executing the image in a new container, and it binds port 8080
on your computer to port 8080 inside the Docker container.  That's the default port that Jetty uses.

If we run that script:

```
$ ./run.sh
Copying cheshire-6.0.0.jar
Copying transit-clj-1.0.333.jar
...
Copying src
Copying web.xml
Created target/app.war

```

Again, there will be a lot of downloads the first time you run this script ... but in the end, Jetty starts up and immediately deploys the `ROOT.war` file.

Jetty will continue to run until you enter kbd:[Ctrl-C], so in another window, you can use `curl` to send a request to the application:

```
$ curl -v localhost:8080/hello
* Host localhost:8080 was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying [::1]:8080...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8080
> GET /hello HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Server: Jetty(12.0.22)
< Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
< X-Frame-Options: DENY
< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
Greetings from inside the WAR file.
$
```

The `-v` option shows the headers and data sent and received; you can not only see the
content provided by the `hello` handler function, but you can also see all the headers
provided by the default interceptors.

== Conclusion

Deploying a Pedestal application as a WAR file is a completely viable approach, especially
useful when the Pedestal application must work along-side pure-Java servlets and servlet filters.

In fact, the Clojure code is the smallest part of this guide - much work was needed to package up the code into a WAR file, and a bit more (specific to this guide) to deploy that WAR file into a Docker container.
