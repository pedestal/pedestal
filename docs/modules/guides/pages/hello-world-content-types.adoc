= Hello World, With Content Types

== Welcome Back

In the first two parts of this trail, we made a
xref:hello-world.adoc[basic service]
and we enhanced it to
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[accept a query parameter].

Both of these returned their responses as plain text. Plain text is
not particularly useful: it doesn't excel at presentation the way that HTML does,
and it doesn't offer structured data to a smart client the way JSON
(or XML, or EDN, or a number of other formats) would.

In fact, we should go a step further: the client should be in charge
of whether they get human-presentable HTML, or code-focused JSON, using
the very same endpoints.

Content types are used in HTTP for three purposes:

- The client includes a `Content-Type` header to describe the format of the request body
- The client includes an `Accepts` header to indicate what body formats it can handle
- The server includes a `Content-Type` header to describe the actual format of the response body

There's quite a bit of inherent complexity there, but Pedestal can help sort it all out.

It's time to see how Pedestal handles content types and response bodies.
We will also get our first taste of interceptors.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Add interceptors to routes.
- Use functions to create interceptors.
- Use the response map.
- Transform responses into other content types.

== Guide Assumptions

Like xref:hello-world.adoc[], this guide is for beginners who
are new to Pedestal and may be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any
prior experience with a Clojure-based web framework. You should be
familiar with the basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content
types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to xref:your-first-api.adoc[] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

== Getting Help if You're Stuck

include::partial$getting-help.adoc[]

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we will build on the same `hello.clj` that we've built
up over the last two guides. We will enhance it to return a JSON
content body. Then we will add the ability to look at the client's
preferred content type and make a decision about what to return.

== Before We Begin

If you worked through xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[]
then you already have all the files you need. If
not, take a moment to grab the sources from the
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc#whole-shebang[whole shebang] in
that guide.  Feel free to browse the complete sources in
link:{guides_examples_root}/hello-content[the
repository], but be warned that the file contains all the versions
that we built up through the previous guide. You'll need to navigate
some magic comments to pare it down to just the final version.

== The Hard Way

Pedestal includes effective support for handilng content type issues on
both the request and the response.

In order to appreciate what Pedestal offers, we'll do it "the hard way",
implementing our own support for content types and gradually improving them.
This is to show you what goes on under the hood before we use
the handy built-in features that Pedestal offers. Don't worry, this
won't hurt too much. It'll also let us introduce the most important
concept in Pedestal: xref:reference:interceptors.adoc[].

Back in xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[]
we echoed an HTTP request back
as the response. That was pretty useful for debugging, and it will
come in handy for our next step.

Given that we put some effort into getting our `/greet` route working
so nicely, let's make a new, general route to just echo requests back. Pop
open `hello.clj` and change the `routes` definition to this:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]
----

When you restarted your service, you probably got a nasty message from Clojure like:

```
user=> (require :reload 'hello)
Syntax error compiling at (hello.clj:55:3).
Unable to resolve symbol: echo in this context
user=>
```

That is a very precise way to say we forgot to define `echo` before using it in the `routes` definition.
Let's do that now.

We're going to define `echo` differently than our handler function
`greet-handler`. Instead of a simple handler _function_, we're going to define
an interceptor.

[#interceptors]
== Interceptors

xref:reference:interceptors.adoc[] are the basic unit of work in Pedestal.

At every step of the way between when a request arrives from the client, and when a response
is sent back, there's at least one interceptor. This includes:

- Parsing query parameters
- Routing the incoming request
- Logging the request
- Constructing the full response

An interceptor is essentially a simple map, but the values for the most important
keys are not simple values (like strings or numbers), but functions.

image::interceptors.png[]

This identifies two _phases_: *enter* and *leave*.  Each interceptor may participate in
the phase by providing corresponding callback functions in the :enter and :leave keys (respectively)
footnote:[There's also an error phase that we'll not discuss in this guide].

Some interceptors only do work during the enter phase, some only during the leave phase, and some
do work during both phases. An interceptor that omits the :enter or :leave key will just be skipped -- it's not an error.

But what does that work entail?  It's essentially a bucket brigade: each interceptor is passed
the xref:reference:context-map.adoc[], is free to perform other work if necessary, and returns
a modified context map, which is passed to the next interceptor. An _interceptor chain_ is the process of executing a sequence of interceptors.

Part of the context map is the interceptor queue, and the interceptor stack; the queue
is a list of interceptors who have yet to be invoked during the enter phase.  As interceptors
are invoked{empty}footnote:[Actually,
interceptors are added to the stack even if they don't provide a :enter callback],
they are also added to the interceptor stack, which is used during the leave phase.

Because it's a stack, the leave phase invokes the interceptors in the opposite order from
the enter phase:

image::interceptor-stack.png[]

Handler functions, like `respond-hello` in our example, are special
cases. Pedestal can wrap a plain old Clojure function with an
interceptor that takes the request map out of the context map, passes
it to the function, and uses the return value of the function as the
xref:reference:response-map.adoc[]
{empty}footnote:[That actually takes more words to explain in English
than it does in code!].

[IMPORTANT]
====
As soon as _any_ interceptor attaches a
:response key to the context map, Pedestal considers the request
handled. Remaining interceptors in the interceptor queue won't be called, and only the ones
that are already on the interceptor stack will be invoked during the leave phase.
This is a "short-circuit" behavior, like an early-exit in code.
====

My advice is to build your value in the context with :enter
functions, turn it into a response at the tail end of the interceptor
queue, and then refine the response map with defaults, headers, cookies,
and so on in :leave functions.

[#echo-interceptor]
== An Echo Interceptor

We're ready to define `echo` as an interceptor:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=echo]
----
<1> Interceptors should always have distinct names.
<2> We're providing an :enter function (but not a :leave function).
<3> Take the request map out of the context map.
<4> Make a response map, with the request map as the body.
<5> Attach the response to the context map, and return the new context map.

We normally wouldn't write this in such an expanded form, but I wanted
to show all the pieces one by one. Ultimately, we're just making a map
with the keys :name and :enter.

We can try that interceptor out now. Bounce your service and use `curl` to exercise the `/echo` route:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/echo
{:remote-addr "127.0.0.1", :start-time 654778320605125, :headers {"accept" "*/*", "host" "localhost:8890", "user-agent" "curl/8.7.1"}, :async-channel #object[org.httpkit.server.AsyncChannel 0x7e67b292 "/127.0.0.1:8890<->/127.0.0.1:55832"], :server-port 8890, :content-length 0, :websocket? false, :content-type nil, :path-info "/echo", :character-encoding "utf8", :url-for #object[clojure.lang.Delay 0x3d9b3fd {:status :pending, :val nil}], :uri "/echo", :server-name "localhost", :query-string nil, :path-params {}, :body nil, :scheme :http, :request-method :get}%
----

This should look pretty familiar from xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[the previous guide].

== From Routes to Interceptors

Pedestal's basic unit of work is the interceptor.  The `echo` and `greet-handler` functions?
Those are actually converted into interceptors.  The `conn/with-routes` in our setup?  That creates
a routing interceptor and adds it to the list of interceptors in the connector map. The routing interceptor
examines the request map and matches it to a route, and pushes the interceptors for the route onto
the queue for execution.

Because the interceptor queue is stored in the context, it means any  interceptor can modify the queue!
There's nothing that special about the routing interceptor. This is
one of the big benefits of using interceptors: the ability to make
dynamic decisions during request handling.

Each Pedestal connector implementation  may inject some interceptors to the front of the queue, before adding all the
interceptors you directly, or indirectly, define in the connector map.

== Returning to Content Types

Pedestal connectors are required to allow any of the following types in the :body of the response map:

.Response Content Type Mapping
|===
| Object in :body                        | Default Content-Type

| Byte array                             | application/octet-stream
| String                                 | text/plain
| Clojure collection (list, set, map)    | application/edn
| java.io.File                           | application/octet-stream
| java.io.InputStream                    | application/octet-stream
| java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel  | application/octet-stream
| java.nio.ByteBuffer                    | application/octet-stream
|===

For each type, the connector will assign a `Content-Type` header, if not already present, based
on the type of value.  In our previous attempts with the `greet-handler`, we returned a String
and Pedestal supplied the content type `text/plain` for us.

The built-in logic does a reasonable job for common cases, but it's not always right. You might notice
that "text/html" doesn't appear anywhere in that list. We can force
that by setting a content type header in our response, like this:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ok_html]
----
<1> Attach a header declaring the content type. Note that the key, "Content-Type", is case sensitive in the response map.

Let's see the result:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/html <1>
content-length: 14
Server: Pedestal/http-kit
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:16:35 GMT

Hello, world! <2>
----
<1> Pedestal honored our `Content-Type` header ...
<2> ... even though we returned plain text.

As expected. But, something about that doesn't seem quite right. We're
completely ignoring HTTP content negotiation. The client might want
JSON instead of HTML. Or it might _want_ plain text. Or EDN. The
trouble is that the HTTP content negotiation specification is a royal
pain. Fortunately, Pedestal provides an interceptor to help.

The api:negotiate-content[ns=io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation] interceptor
does the job. If you look at the docs, though, you'll see that is not
an interceptor, but rather a function that returns an interceptor.

This is a common pattern when you need to include some state or
customize the behavior of an interceptor. You pass arguments to a
function which returns an interceptor that "closes over" those
arguments. It returns a data structure that contains functions that
carry those arguments around with them.

So what does this interceptor do?  It reads the client's `Accept` request header
(which can have quite a complicated format) and finds the "best match" among
the supported content types; this is added to the request map as the key :accept.

If the client doesn't accept any format that the server supports, then a 406 Not acceptable
response is attached to the context.

Let's remove the content type header from `ok` and use this new interceptor.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ns,continuo]

include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=routing_conneg]
----
<1> We'll need this namespace soon to emit JSON responses.
<2> This is the content negotiation namespace for Pedestal.
<3> A short, picky list of content types we can emit.
<4> Notice this route now has a vector of interceptors to invoke.

We are using a new namespace here, which will eventually let us write JSON data. That namespace comes from a library that we haven't included before. So if you try to run this as is, you'll get an error like this:

```
Execution error (FileNotFoundException) at hello/eval140$loading (hello.clj:2).
Could not locate clojure/data/json__init.class, clojure/data/json.clj or clojure/data/json.cljc on classpath.
```

That is how Clojure tells you it is missing a library. By looking at
the library's https://github.com/clojure/data.json[project page], we see that the latest stable release is
"2.5.1" (at least, it is when this guide is being written!). We can
add the library in the dependencies part of our `deps.edn` file:

[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$hello-content/deps.edn[]
----
<1> This is the line that was added.

[TIP]
====
Any time you change your project dependencies, you'll need to quit out of
the REPL and start it again; Clojure will download, as needed, the new dependencies or
dependency versions.  The `(require :reload ...)` trick only works for reloading
source files, not what's in `deps.edn`.
====

If you try this out, you'll notice that absolutely nothing
changed. That's because the content negotiation interceptor handles
the protocol, but it's up to you to do something about the result, the :accept key added to the request map.

This gets to the heart of interceptors: breaking up your request processing
logic into small, resuable, individually testable chunks.

It's up to our service code to return a different body format
depending on the accepted content type. It probably won't surprise you
that this is a job for another interceptor!

Here's our first stab at it.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_entangled]
----
<1> Get the result of the content negotiation interceptor. Use "text/plain" as a fallback in case no suitable match was found.
<2> Get the current response out of the context map, get the current body out of the response. This must have been created by a previous interceptor's :enter or :leave function.
<3> Translate the body according to the chosen content type.
<4> Create a new response by attaching headers and the coerced body.
<5> Return a new context by attaching the updated response.
<6> Tell Pedestal to put this interceptor at the head of the queue _just for this one route_

Why does this new interceptor go at the start of the vector? Take look
at the picture of the interceptors above. The first one in the vector
is called _first_ for the :enter function but _last_ for the :leave
function. We want this interceptor to get the last word on the
response body so it goes at the top. Turn the queue sideways to write
it as a vector, and the topmost interceptor is on the left. It only
takes a little bit to get used to this.

Let's try this out with curl. Restart your service and try sending in some curl requests with different `Accept` headers:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/html
content-length: 14
Server: Pedestal/http-kit
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:43:51 GMT

Hello, world!
----

Notice the content type returned by our service is now "text/html."  This is because the `curl` command, by default,
sends an `Accept` header with the value `*/*`.  This matches the first value in `supported-types`, so that's what's
selected by the `content-negotiation-interceptor`.

We can use the `-H` option to override `curl` 's default.
Keep an eye on the "Content-Type" header in each response.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Accept: text/html" http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:44:52 GMT

Hello, world!

Server: Pedestal/http-kit
Date: Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:45:10 GMT

"Hello, world!\n"
----

Notice when asking for the response in `application/edn` format, the string result was enclosed in quotes.
That's the difference between encoding a string as plain text -- the string itself -- and encoding it
in the EDN format, where strings are quoted.

== Refactoring and Style

So `coerce-body-interceptor` works as intended. As usual, I've
written it in a fairly "non-compact" style so it is easier to see how
the parts work with Pedestal. I see a couple of things we can improve
though.

First, there's a straight-up bug. If a previous interceptor has
already defined a content type, we should respect that and not
overwrite the body or the headers. Second, we're attaching a new
headers map with _only_ the "Content-Type" header. Any other headers
attached by other interceptors will be lost. Finally, we could improve
the testability by factoring out some of its logic into pure
functions.

We're also going to touch up the `echo` interceptor while we're at it.

It is common style in Pedestal applications to make heavy use of the
core functions such as
clj:update[] and clj:update-in[].
These functions can "reach into" a data structure and make changes to the values
already stored there, by applying a function to the stored value.  Of course, this is Clojure
and the original map isn't changed, even by `update-in`: new immutable copies of the
nested and containing maps are created.

Using the update style is s more concise than our prior code, and, to a more experienced Clojure developer, often
more readable.

Let's see how this interceptor would change if we refactor it that way.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_refactored_comm;coerce_body_1;routes_refactored]
----

We're going to take one more step toward Clojure mastery. Do you see
the `coerce-body` function? It looks inside the context. If there's
already a `Content-Type` header on the response, then it does nothing
and returns the context without modification. On the other hand, if
there is no content type assigned yet, it modifies the context by
updating the response.

This is a really common pattern in functional languages. You want to
make a series of changes to a data structure, where each change is
conditional on some other logic. In an imperative language, this would
look like a series of `if` statements whose bodies each mutate the
object being built. In Clojure, they would look like a deeply nested
`if` forms, where each `if` returns either a modified or
unmodified version of the input. The trouble with deeply nested `if`s
is that it's too easy to get lost in the nesting.

This pattern is very common, and Clojure includes macros to help.
The slightly tricky clj:cond\->[]{empty}footnote:[That's read out loud as "cond arrow". Once you master it,
you'll really level up in Clojure skills.] macro is what we need here.
`cond\->` is similar to the usual
threading macro `\->`, but instead of a just a series of expressions, it precedes
each expression with a condition; the condition is evaluated first, and only if true is the value threaded through the expression.

In practice, it's very straight forward:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_body_2]
----
<1> This _predicate function_ makes the main function more readable; the `?` suffix is a convention for functions
     that return a boolean (true or false) result.
<2> This is the test clause.
<3> When the test is true, `cond->` puts `context` in the second position here, right after the `update`

If there were more clauses in the `cond->`, each clause would receive
the value returned from the previous clauses.

== The Whole Shebang

We're now getting a fair bit of code. This would be a good time to
think about splitting into namespaces for different
responsibilities. We'll tackle that some other time. For now, let's
take a look at the whole thing. Spend some time making sure you
understand how and when each line of code gets invoked.

[source.hide-callouts,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ns;continuo;coerce_refactored_comm;coerce_body_2;routes_refactored;connector]
----

== The Path So Far

In this guide, we built upon xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[] to add:

* Rudimentary content negotiation.
* Response body transforms.

We also learned about interceptors and created a few.

== Where To Next?

The truth is that server-side applications don't vend out HTML nearly
as much as they once did. APIs are where it's at. In the
xref:your-first-api.adoc[next tutorial] we will make a REST style API to serve
up "TO DO" lists.
