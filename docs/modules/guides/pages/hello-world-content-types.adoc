= Hello World, With Content Types

== Welcome Back

In the first two parts of this trail, we made a
xref:hello-world.adoc[basic service]
and we enhanced it to
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[accept a query parameter].

Both of these returned their responses as plain text. Plain text is
not particularly useful: it doesn't excel at presentation the way that HTML does,
and it doesn't offer structured data to a smart client the way JSON
(or XML, or EDN, or a number of formats) would.

In fact, we should go a step further: the client should be in charge
of whether they get human-presentable HTML, or code-focused JSON, using
the very same endpoints.

It's time to see how Pedestal handles content types and response bodies.
We will also get our first taste of interceptors.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Add interceptors to routes.
- Use functions to create interceptors.
- Use the response map.
- Transform responses into other content types.

== Guide Assumptions

Like link:hello-world[Hello World], this guide is for beginners who
are new to Pedestal and may be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any
prior experience with a Clojure-based web framework. You should be
familiar with the basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content
types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to link:your-first-api[Your First API] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

If you like to jump straight in to the deep end, you might be
interested in the link:crash-course[Pedestal Crash Course] which
assumes you know quite a bit about Clojure and web frameworks.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

include::partial$getting-help.adoc[]

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we will build on the same `hello.clj` that we've built
up over the last two guides. We will enhance it to return a JSON
content body. Then we will add the ability to look at the client's
preferred content type and make a decision about what to return.

== Before We Begin

If you worked through xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[]
then you already have all the files you need. If
not, take a moment to grab the sources from the
xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc#_the_whole_shebang[whole shebang] in
that guide.  Feel free to browse the complete sources in
link:{guides_examples_root}/hello-content[the
repository], but be warned that the file contains all the versions
that we built up through the previous guide. You'll need to navigate
some magic comments to pare it down to just the final version.

== The Hard Way

Our first effort to deal with content types will be pretty
manual. This is to show you what goes on under the hood before we use
the handy built-in features that Pedestal offers. Don't worry, this
won't hurt too much. It'll also let us introduce the most important
concept in Pedestal: Interceptors.

Back in xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[]
we echoed an HTTP request back
as the response. That was pretty useful for debugging, and it will
come in handy for our next step. Since our `/greet` route is working
so nicely, let's make a general route to just echo requests back. Pop
open `hello.clj` and change the `routes` definition to this:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=routing]
----

You probably noticed that `routes` is created with a `def` and not with a
`defn`. `def` creates a var and binds a value to that var. Under the
jargon, that means it creates a new name in the namespace and attaches
a value. `defn` is a macro that essentially expands into `def` with a
`fn`, hence the name.

In practice, when you see a `def`, you should think "this is creating
a value, and values don't change." So it is with the routes. After
changing the routes, you will need to restart your service.

[sidebar]
This is purely a result of the way we've built things for this guide. There
are techniques that let you automatically reload routes during
development. We'll get to those in
xref:developing-at-the-repl.adoc[].

When you restarted your service, you probably got a nasty message from Clojure like:

```
user=> (require :reload 'hello)
Syntax error compiling at (hello.clj:55:3).
Unable to resolve symbol: echo in this context
user=>
```

That is a very precise way to say we forgot to define `echo` before using it. Let's do that now.

We're going to define `echo` differently than our handler function
`hello`. Instead of a simple handler function, we're going to define
an interceptor.

== Interceptors

Interceptors are the basic unit of work in Pedestal.

At every step of the way between when a request arrives from the client, and when a response
is sent back, there's at least one interceptor. This includes:

- Parsing query parameters
- Routing the incoming request
- Logging the request
- Constructing the full response

An interceptor is essentially a simple map, but the values for the most important
keys are not simple values (like strings or numbers), but functions.

image::interceptors.png[]

This identifies two _phases_: *enter* and *leave*.  Each interceptor may participate in
the phase by providing corresponding callback functions in the :enter and :leave keys (respectively)
footnote:[There's also an error phase that we'll not discuss in this guide].

Some interceptors only do work during the enter phase, some only during the leave phase, and some
do work during both phases. An interceptor that omits the :enter or :leave key will just be skipped -- it's not an error.

But what does that work entail?  It's essentially a bucket brigade: each interceptor is passed
the xref:reference:context-map.adoc[], is free to perform other work if necessary, and returns
a modified context map, which is passed to the next interceptor.

Part of the context map is the interceptor queue, and the interceptor stack; the queue
is a list of interceptors who have yet to be invoked during the enter phase.  As interceptors
are invoked{empty}footnote:[Actually,
interceptors are added to the stack even if they don't provide a :enter callback],
they are also added to the interceptor stack, which is used during the leave phase.

Because it's a stack, the leave phase invokes the interceptors in the opposite order from
the enter phase:

image::interceptor-stack.png[]

Handler functions, like `respond-hello` in our example, are special
cases. Pedestal can wrap a plain old Clojure function with an
interceptor that takes the request map out of the context map, passes
it to the function, and uses the return value of the function as the
xref:reference:response-map.adoc[]
{empty}footnote:[That actually takes more words to explain in English
than it does in code!].

[IMPORTANT]
====
As soon as _any_ interceptor attaches a
:response key to the context map, Pedestal considers the request
handled. Remaining interceptors in the interceptor queue won't be called, and only the ones
that are already on the interceptor stack will be invoked during the leave phase.
This is a "short-circuit" behavior, like an early-exit in code.
====

My advice is to build your value in the context with :enter
functions, turn it into a response at the tail end of the interceptor
queue, and then refine the response map with defaults, headers, cookies,
and so on in :leave functions.

== An Echo Interceptor

We're ready to define `echo` as an interceptor:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=echo]
----
<1> Interceptor names help with debugging.
<2> We're providing an :enter function.
<3> Take the request map out of the context map.
<4> Make a response map out of it.
<5> Attach the response to the context map, and return the new context map.

We normally wouldn't write this in such an expanded form, but I wanted
to show all the pieces one by one. Ultimately, we're just making a map
with the keys :name and :enter.

We can try that interceptor out now. Bounce your service and use curl to exercise the `/echo` route:

[source,bash]
----
> curl http://localhost:8890/echo
{:protocol "HTTP/1.1", :async-supported? true, :remote-addr "127.0.0.1", :servlet-response #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.Response 0x1ea4d091 "HTTP/1.1 200 \nDate: Thu, 12 Oct 2023 20:43:21 GMT\r\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains\r\nX-Frame-Options: DENY\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\r\nX-Download-Options: noopen\r\nX-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none\r\nContent-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;\r\nContent-Type: application/edn\r\n\r\n"], :servlet #object[io.pedestal.http.servlet.FnServlet 0x6593f4fd "io.pedestal.http.servlet.FnServlet@6593f4fd"], :headers {"accept" "*/*", "user-agent" "curl/8.1.2", "host" "localhost:8890"}, :server-port 8890, :servlet-request #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.Request 0x1a57fb49 "Request(GET //localhost:8890/echo)@1a57fb49"], :path-info "/echo", :url-for #object[clojure.lang.Delay 0xd0b64a9 {:status :pending, :val nil}], :uri "/echo", :server-name "localhost", :query-string nil, :path-params {}, :body #object[org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInputOverHTTP 0x28234bf2 "HttpInputOverHTTP@28234bf2[c=0,q=0,[0]=null,s=STREAM]"], :scheme :http, :request-method :get, :context-path ""}%
----

This should look pretty familiar from xref:hello-world-query-parameters.adoc[the previous guide].

== From Routes to Interceptors

When Pedestal starts your service, it sets up some default
interceptors for you. That includes an interceptor that does the
routing. A router is just a specialized interceptor that looks at
parts of the request, decides which interceptors to invoke next, and
pushes those onto the interceptor queue.

That means any other interceptor can _also_ modify the queue! This is
one of the big benefits of using interceptors: the ability to make
dynamic decisions during request handling.

== Returning to Content Types

Pedestal is agnostic as to what servlet container (such as xref:reference:jetty.adoc[]) is used to
accept requests and return responses. At the core of Pedestal is the
xref:reference:servlet-interceptor.adoc[]footnote:[This is poorly named as it's neither a Servlet nor an interceptor!], which is the bridge between the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta_Servlet[Servlet API] (the domain of the servlet container) and Pedestal's interceptors.


The servlet interceptor queues up several interceptors ahead of any provided by the
service{empty}footnote:[Or provided by api:create-service[], such as the routing interceptor], including
the api:ring-response[ns=io.pedestal.impl.servlet-interceptor] interceptor;
part of this interceptor's job is to determine a default response `Content-Type` header,
if the actual response map omits it - this is deduced from the response map's :body.

.Content Type Mapping
|===
| Object in :body                        | Content-Type

| Byte array                             | application/octet-stream
| String                                 | text/plain
| Clojure collection                     | application/edn
| java.io.File                           | application/octet-stream
| java.io.InputStream                    | application/octet-stream
| java.nio.channels.ReadableByteChannel  | application/octet-stream
| java.nio.ByteBuffer                    | application/octet-stream
|===

`ring-response` also uses the body type to determine how to stream the response to the
client; for example, Clojure collections are printed as a string, which is then streamed.
A `File`{empty}'s contents are read and streamed as a byte stream.

`ring-response` does a reasonable job, but it's not always right. You might notice
that "text/html" doesn't appear anywhere in that list. We can force
that by setting a content type header in our response, like this:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ok_html]
----
<1> Attach a header declaring the content type. Note that the key, "Content-Type", is case sensitive in the response map.

Let's see the result:

[source,bash]
----
> curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2023 21:51:05 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/plain
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Hello, world!
----

As expected. But, something about that doesn't seem quite right. We're
completely ignoring HTTP content negotiation. The client might want
JSON instead of HTML. Or it might _want_ plain text. Or EDN. The
trouble is that the HTTP content negotiation spec is a royal
pain. Fortunately, Pedestal provides an interceptor to help.

api:io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation/negotiate-content[ns=io.pedestal.http.content-negotiation]
does the job. If you look at the docs, though, you'll see that is not
an interceptor, but rather a function that returns an interceptor.

This is a common pattern when you need to include some state or
customize the behavior of an interceptor. You pass arguments to a
function which returns an interceptor that "closes over" those
arguments. It returns a data structure that contains functions that
carry those arguments around with them.

Let's remove the content type header from `ok` and use this interceptor.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ns,continuo]

include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=routing_conneg]
----
<1> We'll need this namespace soon to emit JSON responses.
<2> This is the content negotiation namespace for Pedestal.
<3> A short, picky list of content types we can emit.
<4> Notice this route now has a vector of interceptors to invoke.

We are using a new namespace here, which will eventually let us write JSON data. That namespace comes from a library that we haven't included before. So if you try to run this as is, you'll get an error like this:

```
Execution error (FileNotFoundException) at hello/eval140$loading (hello.clj:2).
Could not locate clojure/data/json__init.class, clojure/data/json.clj or clojure/data/json.cljc on classpath.
```

That is how Clojure tells you it is missing a library. By looking at
the library's https://github.com/clojure/data.json[project page], we see that the latest stable release is
"2.4.0" (at least, it is when this guide is being written!). We can
add the library in the dependencies part of our `deps.edn` file:

[source,clojure]
.deps.edn
----
include::example$hello-content/deps.edn[]
----

Any time you change the dependencies, you will definitely need to
restart your service.

If you try this out, you'll notice that absolutely nothing
changed. That's because the content negotiation interceptor handles
the protocol, but it's up to you to do something about the result. The
interceptor runs the algorithm, then attaches the result to the
request. That result is then available throughout the rest of
processing. This is a great way to decompose your interceptors into
small pieces that can be plugged together.

It's up to our service code to return a different body format
depending on the accepted content type. It probably won't surprise you
that this is a job for another interceptor!

Here's our first stab at it.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_entangled]
----
<1> Get the result of the content negotiation interceptor. Use "text/plain" as a fallback in case no suitable match was found.
<2> Get the current response out of the context map, get the current body out of the response. This must have been created by a previous interceptor's `enter` or `leave` function.
<3> Translate the body according to the chosen content type.
<4> Create a new response by attaching headers and the coerced body.
<5> Return a new context by attaching the updated response.
<6> Tell Pedestal to put this interceptor at the head of the queue.

Why does this new interceptor go at the start of the vector? Take look
at the picture of the interceptors above. The first one in the vector
is called _first_ for the `enter` function but _last_ for the `leave`
function. We want this interceptor to get the last word on the
response body so it goes at the top. Turn the queue sideways to write
it as a vector, and the topmost interceptor is on the left. It only
takes a little bit to get used to this.

Let's try this out with curl. Restart your service and try sending in some curl requests with different "Accept" headers:

[source,bash]
----
> curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2023 22:06:52 GMT
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff

Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Hello, world!
----

Notice the content type returned by our service was "text/html." Let's try some others. Keep an eye on the "Content-Type" header in each response.

[source,bash]
----
> curl -i -H "Accept: text/html" http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2023 22:07:18 GMT

X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/html
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Hello, world!

> curl -i -H "Accept: application/edn" http://localhost:8890/greet
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 12 Oct 2023 22:08:07 GMT

Content-Type: application/edn
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

"Hello, world!\n"%
----

Notice when asking for the response in `application/edn` format, the string result was enclosed in quotes.

== Refactoring and Style

So `coerce-body-interceptor` works as intended. As usual, I've
written it in a fairly "non-compact" style so it is easier to see how
the parts work with Pedestal. I see a couple of things we can improve
though.

First, there's a straight-up bug. If a previous interceptor has
already defined a content type, we should respect that and not
overwrite the body or the headers. Second, we're attaching a new
headers map with _only_ the "Content-Type" header. Any other headers
attached by other interceptors will be lost. Finally, we could improve
the testability by factoring out some of its logic into pure
functions.

We're also going to touch up the `echo` interceptor while we're at it.

It is common style in Pedestal applications to make heavy use of the
core functions like `update` and `update-in`. They are good at taking
out a part of a nested data structure, applying a function to it, then
reattaching the updated part. Let's see how this interceptor would
change if we refactor it that way.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_refactored_comm;coerce_body_1;routes_refactored]
----

We're going to take one more step toward Clojure mastery. Do you see
the `coerce-body` function? It looks inside the context. If there's
already a "Content-Type" header on the response, then it does nothing
and returns the context without modification. On the other hand, if
there is no content type assigned yet, it modifies the context by
updating the response.

This is a really common pattern in functional languages. You want to
make a series of changes to a data structure, where each change is
conditional on some other logic. In an imperative language, this would
look like a series of `if` statements whose bodies each mutate the
object being built. In Clojure, they would look like a deeply nested
`if` special form, where each `if` returns either a modified or
unmodified version of the input. The trouble with deeply nested `if`s
is that it's too easy to get lost in the nesting.

This pattern is very common, and Clojure includes macros to help.
The slightly tricky clj:cond\->[]footnote:[That's read out loud as "cond arrow". Once you master it,
you'll really level up in Clojure skills.] macro is what we need here.
`cond\->` is similar to the usual
threading macro `\->`, but instead of a just a series of expressions, it precedes
each expression with a condition; the condition is evaluated first, and only if true is the value threaded through the expression.

In practice, it's very straight forward:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=coerce_body_2]
----
<1> This is the test clause. It says "if there is no Content-Type header"
<2> When the test is true, `cond->` puts `context` in the second position here, right after the `update-in`

If there were more clauses in the `cond->`, each clause would receive
the value returned from the previous clauses.

== The Whole Shebang

We're now getting a fair bit of code. This would be a good time to
think about splitting into namespaces for different
responsibilities. We'll tackle that some other time. For now, let's
take a look at the whole thing. Spend some time making sure you
understand how and when each line of code gets invoked.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-content/src/hello.clj[tags=ns;continuo;coerce_refactored_comm;coerce_body_2;routes_refactored;server]
----

== The Path So Far

In this guide, we built upon link:hello-world-query-parameters[Hello World, With Parameters] to add:

* Rudimentary content negotiation.
* Response body transforms.

We also learned about interceptors and created a few.

== Where To Next?

The truth is that server-side applications don't vend out HTML nearly
as much as they once did. APIs are where it's at. In the
xref:your-first-api.adoc[next tutorial] we will make a REST style API to serve
up "TO DO" lists.
