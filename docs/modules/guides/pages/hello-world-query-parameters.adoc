= Hello World, With Parameters

== Welcome Back

Now that you've gone through the basics in xref:hello-world.adoc[the Hello
World guide] it's time to go one level deeper. We're going to add two
features. That will be our vehicle to talk about some important
concepts in Pedestal.

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Accept query parameters.
- Use the request map.
- Apply logic in your handler.
- Conditionally return an error.
- Return HTML in your response.

== Guide Assumptions

Like xref:hello-world.adoc[], this guide is for beginners who
are new to Pedestal and may be new to Clojure. It doesn't assume any
prior experience with a Clojure-based web framework. You should be
familiar with the basics of HTTP: URLs, response codes, and content
types.

If you've already done some of those other things, you might want to
skip ahead to xref:your-first-api.adoc[] to start building
some logic and multiple routes.

This guide also assumes that you are in a Unix-like development
environment, with Java installed. We've tested it on Mac OS X and
Linux (any flavor) with great results. We haven't yet tried it on the
Windows Subsystem for Linux, but would love to hear from you if you've
succeeded with it there.

== Getting Help If You're Stuck

include::partial$getting-help.adoc[]

== Where We Are Going

In this guide, we will build on the `hello.clj` example from
xref:hello-world.adoc[the previous guide].
We will enhance it to take a single parameter in the URL and return a friendly greeting to that person.

There are some people we don't want to meet, though. So we'll also
include a list of names that should *not* be said. Then we can make
our handler function a bit smarter. If any forbidden name is uttered,
our handler will return a 404 response instead of a cordial greeting.

== Before We Begin

If you worked through xref:hello-world.adoc[], then you already
have all the files you need. If not, take a moment to grab the sources
from
link:{guides_examples_root}/hello[the repository].
That will be our starting point for enhancements this time.

== Accepting Parameters

HTTP offers a few different ways for the client to send data up to our
service. The most basic is probably the URL query parameter. We
usually see these on GET requests, but nothing stops a client from
using them on other request types.

.URL with Query Parameter
====
http://localhost:8890/greet?name=Michael
====

Because query parameters are so common, Pedestal handles them
automatically. You can try that URL with your service right now.

As a reminder, we're running the server by using
the https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli[clj] tool to start an
interactive session (called a REPL, rhymes with ripple) then starting
the service in that session. Before we do that, though, let's discuss
interactive development.

[#interactive]
== Interactive Development

It's really not optimal to be restarting your REPL in order to restart
the service every time you need to make a change. In real Clojure
development, we rarely restart the REPL. Instead, we make our system
friendly to interactive development.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=connector]
----
<1> clj:defonce[] here means we can recompile this file in the same REPL
without overwriting the `*connector` symbol's value.
<2> `reset!` replaces the current value in the atom with the new value.
<3> This is a quick way to bounce the server after reloading code.

First, let's start the Pedestal connector.

----
$ clj
Clojure 1.12.0
user=> (require 'hello)
nil
user=> (hello/start)
#object[io.pedestal.http.http_kit$create_connector$reify__15862 0x3b85a820 "io.pedestal.http.http_kit$create_connector$reify__15862@3b85a820"]
user=>
----

The `start` function has done four things:

- It has created the connector (via `create-connector`)
- It has started the connector
- It has stored the connector in an http://clojure.org/reference/atoms[atom] (a mutable container).
- It has returned the connector, which the Clojure REPL has printed.

[TIP]
====
A convention for mutable objects, such as atoms, is to prefix their name with a `*`.  This is a reminder that
we must use the special prefix `@` to _dereference_ the actual value (the connector object) from the container
(the atom).
====

Now we can use `start`, `stop`, and `restart` functions as we make changes.  Mostly, we'll make code changes,
reload the `hello` namespace, and call `restart` to quickly stop the connector and start a new one.

== Moving along

From another window, let's send a request with a query parameter.

----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Michael <1>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/plain
content-length: 14
Server: Pedestal/http-kit
Date: Fri, 11 Apr 2025 23:37:30 GMT

Hello, world!
----
<1> The backslash before `name` is needed because otherwise the shell will treat the `?` specially.

What we've demonstrated is that Pedestal can route the incoming request, `GET /greet?name=Michael` and isn't
confused by the presence of the query parameter. Ultimately, the `greet-handler` function was invoked,
and did its job. To update `greet-handler` to match our goal, we first have to discuss the
`request` argument passed to it.

Also, if you look in the console of your REPL, you'll see that Pedestal logged the request:

```
[] INFO io.pedestal.service.interceptors - {:msg "GET /greet", :line 40}
```

You'll may see slightly different results, but the takeaway is that you can look
in the REPL session to verify that requests are being processed by your server.

== The Request Map

Here's a reminder of what `greet-handler` currently looks like:

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$hello/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> The function takes one argument, which we call `_request`
<2> ... and it returns a map.

We aren't using the `_request` argument right now, so we don't really
know what information it provides.

Let's take a look at that request by echoing it back to the
client. This is a common debugging trick that you can use.

[source,clojure]
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_debug_body]
----
<1> We're actually using the parameter now, so no more leading `_` on the parameter name.
<2> Instead of returning the string "Hello, world!" we return the _entire_ request as the response body.


Make sure you've update the `hello.clj` file, then restart your service with that new definition:

```
user=> (require :reload 'hello)
nil
user=> (hello/restart)
#object[io.pedestal.http.http_kit$create_connector$reify__15862 0x6f4fa62f "io.pedestal.http.http_kit$create_connector$reify__15862@6f4fa62f"]
user=>
```

Again, this is in two steps: `(require :reload ...)` to update all the Clojure code, then `(hello/restart)`
to stop the connector and start a replacement, using the update functions.

With the updated code live, you can use `curl` again to see the change in the service's behavior:

----
$ curl -i http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Michael

Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains

----
<1> Pedestal uses the `application/edn` content type when the response :body is a Clojure map.  EDN is to Clojure
as JSON is to JavaScript.

Yikes! There's a lot of content in the request map echoed back to us, and it's in one huge line.

We need to unpack that a bit to make sense out of it.  Let's add some line breaks and indentation
to make it easier to read. We'll also omit several keys. They may be relevant later,
but they're a distraction now.

Here's what we are left with.

[source,clojure]
----
{:request-method     :get
 :uri                "/greet"
 :query-string       "name=Michael"
 :query-params       {:name "Michael"}
 :params             {:name "Michael"}
 :headers            {"accept"     "*/*"
                      "host"       "localhost:8890"
                      "user-agent" "curl/8.7.1"}

 :server-port        8890
 :content-length     0
 :content-type       nil
 :path-info          "/greet"
 :character-encoding "utf8"
 :server-name        "localhost"
 :path-params        {}
 :body               nil
 :scheme             :http}
----

This is a xref:reference:request-map.adoc[].
Again, a generic Clojure map with specific keys.
You access its values with the `get` and `get-in` functions.
For now, we'll look at three interesting keys.

The whole query string appears under the :query-string key. That's
the portion of the URL after, but not including, the `?`
character. The query string can be a pain to deal with.
It is
URL-encoded, which means that some common characters, such as spaces and punctuation, are
converted into sequences of several characters.  There's also delimeters between
name/value pairs in the query string.

Pedestal parses and slices all that up into a map of parameters for you, which is attached to
the request map as the :query-params key.
Each parameter name is converted  into a
keyword. Parameter values are always strings, though, so you may still
have to parse them a bit.

Pedestal has several different sources of parameters in the request, which we'll cover in more detail later.
The :params key is the merged map of all params from all sources; :query-params is just the parameters
from the query string.  You get to choose which of these is right for your particular handler.

== Using the Parameter

Inside our handler function, the :name parameter is available inside
a nested map. Let's dig it out and add it to our response.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response]
----
<1> Extract the parameter, bind it to the name `greet-name`.
<2> For the response body, concatenate "Hello," and the parameter into a string.

[TIP]
====
The clj:let[] form is used to define one or more local symbols, much like a block-scoped
local variable in a more traditional language.
====

Here we can just grab the value right out of the map and use it in the
response.

Do the restart/reload dance again, and then use `curl` to try a few different requests with parameters.

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Michael
Hello, Michael
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Pankaj
Hello, Pankaj
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Geeta
Hello, Geeta
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที <1>
Hello, ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=No%20One%20To%20Be%20Trifled%20With <2>
Hello, No One To Be Trifled With
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=
Hello,
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Hello,
----
<1> Unicode, amazingly, doesn't need to be URL-escaped.
<2> ... but common characters such as space, need to be converted (to `%20`).

Dang. We were doing really well right up until the end
there. Obviously we need to do something smarter when the input is
missing. Bad user input is a way of life on the web, so let's not make
an error out of this. Instead, we just won't personalize the greeting.

## Sidequest: Why `greet-name`?

You might have noticed that the `name` query parameter in the URL shows up as the :name key in the
:query-params map, but ultimately ends up in a local symbol, `greet-name`.

It is tempting to just use the symbol `name` here as well, for consistency,
rather than the longer and less obvious `greet-name`.

Long experience has shown that some symbol names, those that conflict with
functions and macros automatically imported from the `clojure.core` namespace, can cause you
great frustration.  Using `name` here _shadows_ the function `clojure.core/name`.

Consider this easy mistake:

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_sidequest]
----

This looks correct at a glance, but consider what happens when it is executed:

```
$ curl -i  http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Michael
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Xss-Protection: 1; mode=block
X-Download-Options: noopen
X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none
Content-Security-Policy: object-src 'none'; script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' 'strict-dynamic' https: http:;
Content-Type: text/plain
content-length: 34
Server: Pedestal/http-kit
Date: Sat, 12 Apr 2025 00:16:42 GMT

Hello, clojure.core$name@6b202ecb
```

`clojure.core$name@6b202ecb` is how the `clojure.core/name` function is printed as a string.
We can verify that in the REPL:

```
user=> (str clojure.core/name)
"clojure.core$name@6b202ecb"
```

So because we used `greet-name` in one place and `name` in the other we got _really strange_ results;
this is partly because Clojure, as a dynamically typed language, is very permissive ... to a point:

[quote,Stuart Halloway]
This is Clojure ... we don't slap your wrists when you are wrong, we just punish you deeply for it later.

So, the moral of the story is to avoid shadowing names!  With that, let us continue on to handling bad input
in the request.

## Handling Bad Input

In those last couple of `curl` calls, we did not properly pass up a `name` query parameter:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=
Hello,
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Hello,
----

This is not desirable behavior; we should do better than returning half a sentence.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_logic]
----
<1> Both nil and a zero-length string count as empty.
<2> This is our fallback greeting message.
<3> And our personalized greeting message.
<4> Generating the response.

Again, reload and restart, then try new requests with `curl`:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet
Hello, world!
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=
Hello, world!
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
Hello, ไอรีนซีพีชาไอที
----

Much better! But our handler function is getting a bit unwieldy. I
don't mean that it is a whole six lines long, but rather that it mixes
too many concerns. This function parses inputs, applies "domain"
logic, and deals with creating a response body. It would be better to
refactor this to separate those concerns.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=response_logic_refactor]
----
<1> This function can generate any "OK" result.
<2> Our logic is now separated.
<3> The handler now coordinates the rest.

This version separates the concerns nicely. One big benefit is that
the `greeting-for` function is now easier to test. It's just a pure
function - no side effects - that doesn't require any HTTP or Pedestal machinery to exercise.
Likewise, that `ok` function is also side effect free and quite easy to test.
Both functions are likely to get more complex, but each one will only deal with its own
complexity.

In this example, we're treating the case of an empty name the same as
if the name parameter just isn't included. See if you can make the
handler more strict: it should return a "400 Bad Request" response if
the name parameter is present but zero length.

== Conditional Responses

There are some names that should not be spoken. Let's enhance our
service to avoid them. This will be a relatively simple change. We can
hardcode the names as a set, then use that set as a function. (Clojure
sets act as functions that test for the presence of their argument in the
set itself.)

This part needs to go before `greeting-for` because we'll use it to
make a decision in that function.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=not_to_be_named]
----

Now we need to think about our `greeting-for` function. Right now it returns
a string. We want to make sure the user gets a 404 if the query names
one of the forbidden ones. We could have `greeting-for` directly
return the response map, but that starts to entangle the concerns we
just factored out. We'll do the simplest thing that could possibly
work: when `greeting-for` returns `nil` (instead of a string),
that means the request failed.

[source,clojure]
.src/hello.clj
----
include::example$hello-query/src/hello.clj[tags=greeting_with_404]
----

Because there are now three possible conditions that can happen in
`greet-handler`, I've changed from using an clj:if[] expression
to a clj:cond[]
expression. `cond` uses pairs of "condition / value" clauses. So if
`(unmentionables greet-name)` returns any truthy value, then `cond` returns
`nil` and stops evaluating. If `(empty? greet-name)` returns true, then `cond`
returns the literal string "Hello, world!\n" and nothing else. If
neither of those happened, then `cond` sees the keyword :else as a
condition{empty}footnote:[Using :else for this purpose is just a common Clojure convention, any non-false/non-nil value would
work equally well.]
and the code continues to build the string the same way as before.

[NOTE]
====
A nested `if` would also have worked here. In fact `cond` is a macro
that expands into a series of nested `if` expressions. All three of
these conditions are kind of parallel in significance, so I like that
they appear to be parallel in the structure of the code. The shape of
the code mirrors the shape of my thinking about these cases.
====

The second thing you'll notice is that the handler now makes a
decision whether to call our `ok` helper or the new function
`not-found`. I do hope you weren't expecting much in `not-found`! It's
as simple as it gets.

Restart your service and give it a try:

----
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Michael
Hello, Michael
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=Rumplestiltskin
Not found
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=曹操
Not found
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=voldemort
Hello, voldemort
$ curl http://localhost:8890/greet\?name=He%20who%20must%20not%20be%20named
Hello, He who must not be named
----

Looks like it mostly works, though it has some trouble with different
capitalization. Take a look at the docs for
clj:*[ns=clojure.string] and see
if you can figure out how to make the comparison case-insensitive.

[#whole-shebang]
== The Whole Shebang

Once again, we built this thing in small steps, so it may seem like
there was a lot to deal with. The final product is still compact and to the point.

== The Path So Far

In this guide, we built upon xref:hello-world.adoc[] to add:

* Query parameters
* General response functions
* "Domain" logic
* Conditional responses

We also learned about the xref:reference:request-map.adoc[], which is central to any
non-trivial handler, as well as one approach to dealing with invalid user input in
the request.

== Where to Next?

So far, almost all our responses have been plain text.

Plain text is ugly, so we want to be able to return HTML. Rich clients
don't like HTML so much, so we also want to return JSON sometimes. The
xref:hello-world-content-types.adoc[next stop] on this trail looks at how
Pedestal handles content types and response bodies. This will also be our
first taste of interceptors, Pedestal's core unit of work.
