= Server Sent Events

WARNING: This document is out of date and will be updated.

== Welcome

Server-sent events (SSE) make it possible to stream events to a client application.
They are appropriate when you only need a unidirectional flow of events from the
server to the client (if you need a bidirectional connection, then WebSockets are
a better choice).

TIP: SSEs have largely been eclipsed by WebSockets, which
xref:reference:websockets.adoc[Pedestal also supports].

== What You Will Learn

After reading this guide, you will be able to:

- Configure Pedestal to accept SSE connections.
- Send events from Pedestal over the connection using {core_async}.
- Connect to the server-sent event stream from a JavaScript client.

== Guide Assumptions

This guide is for intermediate users who have worked through some
sample applications or the first few xref:hello-world.adoc[]
guides. In particular, you should know how to run a build, start a
REPL, and start and stop your server.

You do not need to know any other Clojure web frameworks, but if you
do, you may find some of the comparisons useful. If not, that's OK --
just skip those sections.

== Server Sent Events Overview

In typical client/server interactions, the client, usually a web browser, sends a single request to the server,
and the server responds with a single response.

With SSEs, this is a bit different.  The client still sends a single request, and receives a single response,
but it doesn't get the response all at once.  The response body "stays open", and the server can keep appending
more content to it.

With SSEs, the response content type is `text/event-stream`.  This event stream consists of
multiple "events", short text-based messages.



== Where We Are Going

We'll be creating a new Pedestal service project, adding a simple route to stream a counter using server-sent events, and adding a simple HTML page that uses a JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource[EventSource] to open a connection to the stream.

== Before We Begin

This guide will use http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] to generate and
build a template project. If you haven't already installed it, please
take a few minutes to set it up.

== Generate Our New Project

----
$ lein new pedestal-service server-sent-events
Generating a pedestal-service application called server-sent-events.
$ cd server-sent-events
----

== Add Hiccup

We will be using Hiccup to generate our index page, so we will need to add the
dependency in our project.clj.

[source,clojure]
.project.clj
----
include::example$server-sent-events/project.clj[tags=add-hiccup]
----

== Clean Up

Here's the `service.clj` file generated from the template:

[source,clojure]
.src/server_sent_events/service.clj
----
include::example$server-sent-events/src/server_sent_events/service.clj[tags=original-service]
----

Let's simplify things by commenting out the 'Terse/Vector-based routes' section and removing unnecessary code.

[source,clojure]
.src/server_sent_events/service.clj
----
include::example$server-sent-events/src/server_sent_events/service.clj[tags=cleaned-up]
----

== Server-Sent Event Route

Now let's add our server-sent event route. First Lets require SSE and {core_async}.

[source,clojure]
.src/server_sent_events/service.clj
----
include::example$server-sent-events/src/server_sent_events/service.clj[tags=require-sse]
----

Now we'll add our counter route. We create the `/counter` route by calling
api:start-event-stream[ns=io.pedestal.http.sse]
and passing in our `stream-ready` handler.

This creates an interceptor that will handle setting up the connection and call the provided callback, `stream-ready`.

The `stream-ready`  callback receives a {core_async} event channel and the SSE context as parameters.
The SSE context is the xref:reference:context-map.adoc[] with additional keys related to the event stream.

WARNING: The  callback  *must* send at least one event in order to properly initialize the stream.
If it doesn't, the client will think the stream is broken and keep reconnecting.

[NOTE]
====
An event stream is a particular kind of asynchronous response. The event stream interceptor,
returned by `start-event-stream`, will return a context with a response map, which will trigger a response
being sent to the client. However, the response will include whatever series of values are put into the
provided response channel.
====


You send events on the channel using regular {core_async} functions, such as `put!` or `>!!`,
and ultimately terminate the connection by calling `clojure.core.async/close!` on the channel.

Here our event consists the :name and :data keys, but could also contain an
:id+for the event.

Importantly, it is not the job of your callback to send all of the events; your callback is supposed set in motion
the concurrent machinery that sends the events.  Events will continue to be sent to the client even after
the callback returns, until either the client closes the connection, or your code closes the channel.

[source,clojure]
.src/server_sent_events/service.clj
----
include::example$server-sent-events/src/server_sent_events/service.clj[tags=counter-route]
----

Now let's start up our server.

----
> lein run
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.util.log  - Logging initialized @3094ms to org.eclipse.jetty.util.log.Slf4jLog

Creating your server...
INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server  - jetty-9.4.52.v20230823; built: 2023-08-23T19:29:37.669Z; git: abdcda73818a1a2c705da276edb0bf6581e7997e; jvm 11.0.19+7-LTS

INFO  org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server  - Started @3196ms
----

We can check out our event stream in another terminal using +curl+.

----
> curl http://localhost:8080/counter
event: counter

event: counter

event: counter

----

The events above will arrive at one second intervals.

SSE data will always be received as a string. If you want to send JSON (or any
other data format), it's up to the sender to encode it and the receiver to
decode it accordingly. This agreement must be arranged out-of-band.

[IMPORTANT]
None of the Pedestal interceptors are invoked
when sending SSE events. The interceptors are used for the initial connection
request from the client, but not on the events themselves.

Now let's stop our server with Ctrl+C and update our `/index` route to return an
HTML page that connects to our counter route. Since we are adding inline JS
we'll also update our service configuration not to include secure headers, which
include 'unsafe-inline' by default (this is an example, not production code
after all).

[source,clojure]
.src/server_sent_events/service.clj
----
include::example$server-sent-events/src/server_sent_events/service.clj[tags=html-home]
----

Now we should be able to restart our server and navigate to
http://localhost:8080 and watch our counter increment.

Coverage of the JavaScript EventSource (SSE) API is beyond the scope of this
Pedestal guide. If you are unfamiliar with the API, consult this
link:https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/[tutorial] for a
basic introduction.

== Wrapping Up

We've covered a minimal setup for server-sent event configuration and usage and
demonstrated how to receive events from JavaScript.

This guide was based on the examples in the 
link:{repo_root}/samples/tree/master/server-sent-events[server-sent-event sample project]
and the
xref:reference:server-sent-events.adoc[Server-Sent Events Reference].
