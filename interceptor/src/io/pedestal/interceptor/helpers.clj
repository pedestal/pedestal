  "A collection of interceptor helpers.

  The usage of the Interceptor API is preferred over the macros
  defined in this namespace. Usage of the macro helpers should be
  limited to cases where you are porting an existing Pedestal code
  base.
   
  The helper macros predate the interceptor API and can break AOT
  compilation but they are maintained for backwards
  compatibility. Refer to
  https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/issues/308 and
  https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/pull/301 for more details about
  macro helper issues and the rationale for the Interceptor API."
