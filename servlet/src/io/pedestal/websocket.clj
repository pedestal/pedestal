  The path provides the mapping to the endpoint, and must start with a slash.

  The ws-endpoint-map defines callbacks and configuration for the endpoint.

  When a connection is started for the endpoint, the :on-open callback is invoked; the return value
  is saved as the \"session object\" which is then passed to the remaining callbacks as the first
  function argument.

  :on-open (jakarta.websocket.Session, jakarta.websocket.EndpointConfig)
  : Invoked when client first opens a connection.  The returned value is retained
    and passed as the first argument of the remaining callbacks.

  :on-close (Object, jakarta.websocket.Session, jakarta.websocket.CloseReason)
  : Invoked when the socket is closed, allowing any resources to be freed.

  :on-error (Object, jakarta.websocket.Session, Throwable)
  : Passed any unexpected exceptions.

  :on-text (Object, String)
  : Passed a text message as a single String.

  :on-binary (Object, java.nio.ByteBuffer)
  : Passed a binary message as a single ByteBuffer.

  :configure (jakarta.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig.Builder)

  :subprotocols (vector of String, optional)
  : Configures the subprotocols of the endpoint

  :idle-timeout-ms (long)

  All callbacks are optional.  The :on-open callback is critical, as it performs all the one-time setup
  for the WebSocket connection. The [[on-open-start-ws-connection]] function is a good starting place."
