  "This namespace ties together the many other namespaces to make it possible
  to succinctly define a service and start and stop a server for that service.

  This namespace is generic as to the underlying container for the server;
  in some cases, a namespace will be loaded on the fly to convert a service to
  a server (based on Jetty or Tomcat, or others).

  In addition, there is support here for deploying a Pedestal application as part of a
  WAR file, via the ClojureVarServlet.

  This namespace has been deprecated in 0.8.0 and users are encouraged to
  migrate to the io.pedestal.connector namespace."

  :io.pedestal.http/routes (or ::http/routes if the namespace is aliased to `http`); the interceptor are
  added to the ::interceptors key.

  This function is called from [[create-servlet]] and [[create-provider]].

  When the ::interceptors key is already present in the context, this function does nothing.
  This allows  application code to invoke default-interceptors, and then add or modify those interceptors
  before continuing on towards creating and starting a server.

  Options:

  * :routes: Something that satisfies the [[ExpandableRoutes]] protocol,
    a function that returns expanded routes when called, expanded routes
     (from calling [[expand-routes]], or a _seq of route maps that defines a service's routes_ (this last
     case is _deprecated_).
  * :router: The router constructor to use. Can be :linear-search, :map-tree
    :prefix-tree, :sawtooth, or a custom router constructor function. Defaults to :sawtooth.
  * :file-path: File path used as root by the middlewares/file interceptor (exposing a local directory
     as the root). If nil, this interceptor
    is not added. Default is nil.
  * :resource-path: Resource path (on the classpath) used as root by the [[resource]] interceptor; If nil, no interceptor
    is added. Default is nil. Alternately, include [[resource-routes]] in the :routes key.
  * :method-param-name: Query string parameter used to set the current HTTP verb. Default is `_method`.
  * :allowed-origins: Determines what origins are allowed for the [[allow-origin]] interceptor. If
     nil, this interceptor is not added. Default is nil.
  * :not-found-interceptor: Interceptor to use when returning a not found response. Default is
     the [[not-found]] interceptor. Set to nil to disable.
  * :request-logger: Interceptor to log requests entering the interceptor chain. Default is
     the [[log-request]] interceptor. Set to nil to disable request logging.
  * :mime-types: Mime-types map used by the [[content-type]] interceptor. Defaults to an empty map.
  * :enable-session: A settings map to include the [[session]] middleware interceptor. If nil, this interceptor
     is not added.  Default is nil.
  * :enable-csrf: A settings map to include the [[csrf-protection]] interceptor. This implies
     sessions are enabled. If nil, no interceptor is added. Default is nil.
  * :secure-headers: A settings map for various secure headers.
     Keys are: [:hsts-settings :frame-options-settings :content-type-settings :xss-protection-settings :download-options-settings :cross-domain-policies-settings :content-security-policy-settings]
     If nil, this interceptor is not added.  Default is the default secure-headers settings
  * :path-params-decoder: An interceptor to decode path params. Default [[path-params-decoder]].
     If nil, this interceptor is not added.
  * :tracing: An interceptor to handle telemetry request tracing; this is added as the first interceptor. Defaults
    to [[request-tracing-interceptor]] and can be set to nil to eliminate entirely (added in 0.7.0).


  Note that none of the default interceptors will parse the content of the request body (for POST or other requests);
  individual _routes_ that are of type POST should include the [[body-params]] interceptor to do so."

   Returns a server map, which merges the provided service map with additional keys from
