  the stability suffix is for non-release versions; it can be \"-SNAPSHOT\" or
  \"-beta-<index>\" or \"-rc-<index>\".

  :level - :major, :minor, :patch, :snapshot, :beta, :rc, :release
  :dry-run - print new version number, but don't update
  :commit - see update-version
  :tag - see update-version

  :major, :minor, :patch increment their numbers and discard the stability suffix.
  So \"1.3.4-rc-2\" with level :minor would advance to \"1.4.0\".

  :release strips off the stability suffix so \"1.3.4-rc-3\" with level :release
  would advance to \"1.3.4\".  It's not valid to use level :release with a release version (one with
  no stability suffix).

  :snapshot, :beta, or :rc: If the existing stability matches, then the index number at the end is incremented,
  otherwise the stability is set to the level and the index is set to 1 (except for :snapshot, which has no
  index).

  \"1.3.4\" with level :snapshot becomes \"1.3.4-SNAPSHOT\".
  \"1.3.4-SNAPSHOT\" with level :beta becomes \"1.3.4-beta-1\".
  \"1.3.4-beta-2\" with level :beta becomes \"1.3.4-beta-3\".
