<!--
 The Pedestal application development tools provide a very simple
 system for composing documents. This partial will be included
 "within" the application.html file. The div with id "content" in that
 file will be replaced with the div with id "content" in this file.

 This feature is only part of the tool. It has nothing to do with the
 ClojureScript application that you are building.

<_within file="application.html">
  
  <div id="content">

    <!--
        In the markup below, a template named "hello" is
        defined. This template has two fields: id and message.

        In the file

        app/src/{{sanitized}}/html_templates.clj

        this template can be extracted by calling

        (def template-fn (tfn (tnodes "{{name}}.html" "hello")))

        template-fn is a function which, when called with a map of
        values, will return a string of HTML with filled-in values.

        (template-fn {:id 42 :message "Hello"})

        The field attribute takes a comma delimited list of

        html-element-attribute-name:map-key

        content is a special case which means that the content
        (innerHTML) of the element will be set to this value.

    <div template="hello" field="id:id">

      <div field="content:message" class="message">A Message</div>

    </div>

  </div>
