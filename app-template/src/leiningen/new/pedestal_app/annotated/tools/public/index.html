    <h1>{{name}}</h1>
    <p>
      Congratulations! You have created and run a new Pedestal
      application.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      Hover over the lower right corner of each page to activate the
      control panel. In each view, update source files and then reload
      the page to build and see changes. The items that appear in the
      control panel can be configured in <code>config/config.clj</code>.
    </p>

    <p class="small" style="font-weight:bold">
      Start working on your application by writing its behavior in the
      file <code>app/src/{{sanitized}}/behavior.clj</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Design</h4>
    <small>
      View template files located
      in <code>app/templates</code>. Update the design page by editing
      the file <code>tools/public/design.html</code>.
    </small>
    <h4>Data UI</h4>
    <small>
      After creating application behavior, run the application in the
      browser using the data renderer. The data renderer is setup in
      the file <code>app/src/{{sanitized}}/simulated/start.clj</code>.
    </small>
    <h4>Render</h4>
    <small>
      The data renderer allows you to record the data which is sent to
      a renderer. The Render view allows you to play back these
      recordings. Configure the renderer to use
      in <code>config/config.clj</code>.
    </small>
    <h4>Development</h4>
    <small>
      The development view allows you do run your application with a
      real renderer and feeder. This application is created in
      <code>app/src/{{sanitized}}/start.clj</code>. The application
      will be compiled in development mode for easier debugging.
    </small>
    <h4>Fresh</h4>
    <small>
      Load a page with a ClojureScript REPL client and no application
      code. Use this view to experiment from the REPL without running
      your application. Before you go to this page,
      run <code>(cljs-repl)</code> to start the server side of the
      REPL connection.
    </small>
    <h4>Production</h4>
    <small>
      Run your application with advanced compilation.
